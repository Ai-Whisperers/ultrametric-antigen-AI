Subject: Sequence-only DDG prediction - validated on S669 benchmark

Dear [Dr./Prof. Name],

I came across your work on [specific paper/topic] and thought you might be interested in a new approach to protein stability prediction we've developed.

Our tool uses p-adic geometric embeddings to predict DDG from sequence alone - no 3D structure required. Key results:

- LOO Spearman rho = 0.585 (p < 0.001) on curated S669 subset
- <0.1 second per mutation (vs minutes for physics-based methods)
- Detects "Rosetta-blind" instabilities that structure-based methods miss

The tool is particularly useful for:
- High-throughput screening (filter 1000s of candidates before FoldX/Rosetta)
- Cases where no structure is available
- Identifying hidden instability in apparently stable designs

Repository: https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/ternary-vaes-bioinformatics
Package: deliverables/partners/protein_stability_ddg/

Important caveat: On the full N=669 dataset, our method achieves rho=0.37-0.40, which is competitive but not superior to ESM-1v (0.51) or FoldX (0.48). The N=52 curated subset result should not be directly compared.

Would you be interested in trying it on your data? Happy to discuss the methodology or help with integration.

Best regards,

## 2. Arbovirus Surveillance

### Subject Lines (choose one)
- Pan-arbovirus primer design tool + DENV-4 diversity discovery
- Hyperbolic trajectory forecasting for dengue surveillance
- New tool: RT-PCR primers for 7 arboviruses with evolutionary tracking

### Email Template

```
Subject: Pan-arbovirus primer design tool + DENV-4 diversity discovery

Dear [Dr./Prof. Name],

Your work on [arbovirus surveillance/dengue diagnostics/tropical disease monitoring] caught my attention. We've developed a toolkit that might complement your surveillance efforts.

Our package includes:
1. Pan-arbovirus RT-PCR primer design (DENV-1/2/3/4, Zika, Chikungunya, Mayaro)
2. Hyperbolic trajectory forecasting for serotype dominance prediction
3. Primer stability scanning to identify mutation-resistant targets

Key discovery: Our analysis revealed that 97.4% of DENV-4 sequences have NO conserved 25bp windows - explaining why DENV-4 is often missed in diagnostic panels. This "cryptic diversity" (71.7% identity vs 95-98% for other serotypes) requires clade-specific detection strategies.

The tools work with NCBI sequences and integrate with standard surveillance workflows.

Repository: https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/ternary-vaes-bioinformatics
Package: deliverables/partners/arbovirus_surveillance/

Would you be interested in testing this on your regional sequences? Particularly relevant for South American surveillance programs where DENV-4 circulation is increasing.

## 3. Antimicrobial Peptide Design

### Subject Lines (choose one)
- Multi-objective AMP optimization in VAE latent space
- NSGA-II peptide design for WHO priority pathogens
- Microbiome-safe antimicrobial peptide discovery tool

### Email Template

```
Subject: Multi-objective AMP optimization in VAE latent space

Dear [Dr./Prof. Name],

I noticed your research on [antimicrobial peptides/antibiotic resistance/AMP discovery] and wanted to share a tool we've developed for peptide optimization.

Our package uses NSGA-II multi-objective optimization in a VAE latent space to design AMPs that balance:
- Antimicrobial activity (validated: Spearman rho = 0.656)
- Toxicity (heuristic-based)
- Synthesis feasibility

Three specialized tools included:
1. B1: Pathogen-specific design (A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus, H. pylori)
2. B8: Microbiome-safe AMPs (selectivity index > 1.0 for pathogen vs commensal)
3. B10: Synthesis-optimized peptides (aggregation, racemization, cost prediction)

Important limitation: Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus models have insufficient data (p > 0.1). Acinetobacter, Escherichia, and general models are well-validated.

Repository: https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/ternary-vaes-bioinformatics
Package: deliverables/partners/antimicrobial_peptides/

Would this be useful for your peptide discovery pipeline? Happy to discuss the NSGA-II approach or help validate candidates.

## 4. HIV Clinical Decision Support

### Subject Lines (choose one)
- TDR screening + LA injectable eligibility tools for HIV clinics
- Clinical decision support for HIV treatment optimization
- Stanford HIVdb-integrated resistance screening tools

### Email Template

```
Subject: TDR screening + LA injectable eligibility tools for HIV clinics

Dear [Dr./Prof. Name],

Your work on [HIV treatment/drug resistance/clinical care] prompted me to reach out about clinical decision support tools we've developed.

Our HIV package includes:
1. H6: Transmitted Drug Resistance (TDR) screening for treatment-naive patients
   - WHO-defined SDRM detection
   - First-line regimen recommendations
   - Full drug susceptibility report

2. H7: Long-Acting Injectable (CAB/RPV-LA) eligibility assessment
   - Viral suppression verification
   - Resistance risk evaluation
   - Pharmacokinetic adequacy scoring
   - Adherence history integration

Both tools integrate with Stanford HIVdb for mutation interpretation and can connect to EMR systems for clinical workflow integration.

Repository: https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/ternary-vaes-bioinformatics
Package: deliverables/partners/hiv_research_package/

Would these tools be useful in your clinical setting? We're looking for pilot sites to validate real-world performance.
