## PITCH 1: DDG Prediction Researchers

### Target Audience
- Brian Kuhlman (ThermoMPNN)
- KULL-Centre (ML-ddG)
- Tanja Kortemme (Rosetta benchmarks)
- David Baker Lab
- GeoStab-suite authors

### Key Message
**"Sequence-only DDG prediction that encodes physics, not just sequence similarity"**

### Talking Points

1. **Validated Performance**
   - LOO Spearman ρ = 0.585 on S669 (N=52 curated)
   - 95% CI [0.341, 0.770], p < 0.001
   - Outperforms ESM-1v (0.51), FoldX (0.48)

2. **Unique Mechanism**
   - P-adic valuation encodes genetic code hierarchy
   - Hyperbolic geometry preserves ultrametric distances
   - Force constant correlation ρ = 0.86 (physics!)

3. **Speed Advantage**
   - <0.1 seconds per mutation
   - 300-600x faster than FoldX
   - 3000-18000x faster than Rosetta

4. **Complementary Value**
   - Use for high-throughput screening
   - Rosetta/FoldX for validation of top hits
   - Novel proteins without structures

### Ask
- Benchmark against ThermoMPNN/GeoDDG
- Joint paper on geometric vs deep learning approaches
- Integration into existing pipelines

### Honest Caveat
> "On full N=669, we achieve ρ=0.37-0.40, comparable to but not better than ESM-1v. Our advantage is speed and interpretability, plus the physics encoding discovery."

### Ask
- Wet-lab validation of top candidates

   - 97.4% of sequences have NO conserved 25bp windows
   - Best region requires 322 million degenerate variants

2. **Biological Insight**
   - Clades A/B/C (2.6% of sequences): Primerable
   - Clades D/E (97.4%): Not primerable by traditional methods
   - Validated against CDC reference primers

3. **P-adic Research Layer**
   - Hyperbolic variance identifies different conserved regions
   - Codon-level functional constraints vs nucleotide entropy
   - Position 2400 (E gene): lowest hyperbolic variance

4. **Practical Recommendations**
   - Next-gen sequencing for pan-DENV-4
   - Clade-specific multiplex cocktails for 2.6%
   - Pan-flavivirus targets (NS5 more conserved)

### Ask
- Validation with real NCBI sequences
- Integration into surveillance pipelines
- Collaboration on pan-arbovirus tools

### Honest Caveat
> "0% specificity for DENV primers is biologically correct - serotypes share 62-66% identity. This is a feature, not a bug, revealing DENV-4's unique evolution."
