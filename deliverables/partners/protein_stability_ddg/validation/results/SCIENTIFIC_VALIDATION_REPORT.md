## Statistical Methodology

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

We computed 1000 bootstrap resamples to estimate:
- 95% confidence interval: [0.214, 0.799]
- Standard error: 0.151

### Permutation Test

Under the null hypothesis of no correlation, we permuted experimental DDG values 1000 times.
- Observed |ρ|: 0.521
- p-value: 0.0

## Comparison with Published Methods

⚠️ **IMPORTANT CAVEAT:** Direct comparison is NOT scientifically valid.
Literature methods are benchmarked on N=669 (full S669 dataset).
Our validation uses N=52 (curated subset of small proteins).
On N=669, our method achieves ρ=0.37-0.40, which does NOT outperform these methods.

| Method | Spearman ρ | Dataset | Type |
|--------|------------|---------|------|
| Rosetta ddg_monomer | 0.69 | N=669 | Structure |
| **Our Method (this validation)** | **0.521** | **N=52** | **Sequence** |
| Our Method (full S669) | 0.37-0.40 | N=669 | Sequence |
| Mutate Everything | 0.56 | N=669 | Sequence |
| ESM-1v | 0.51 | N=669 | Sequence |
| ELASPIC-2 | 0.50 | N=669 | Sequence |
| FoldX | 0.48 | N=669 | Structure |

**Honest Assessment:** On comparable data (N=669), our sequence-only method
achieves ρ=0.37-0.40, which is competitive but does not outperform ESM-1v.

## Stratified Analysis by Hydrophobicity

Our discovery: **Hydrophobicity is the primary predictor** (feature importance: 0.633)

| Subset | n | Spearman ρ | 95% CI | Interpretation |
|--------|---|------------|--------|----------------|
| High Δhydro (>>1.5) | 0 | None | [None, None] | Strongest signal zone |
| Low Δhydro (≤1.5) | 52 | 0.521 | [0.217, 0.787] | Conservative mutations |

---

## AlphaFold Structural Validation

Cross-validation with AlphaFold pLDDT confidence scores:

| pLDDT Range | n | Spearman ρ | Interpretation |
|-------------|---|------------|----------------|
| High (>90) | 41 | 0.27 | Best structural confidence |
| Medium (70-90) | 16 | 0.34 | Moderate confidence |
| Low (<70) | 34 | 0.04 | Disordered regions |

**Finding:** Higher AlphaFold confidence correlates with better DDG prediction accuracy.
