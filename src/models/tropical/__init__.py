"""Tropical VAE Module.

Implements a VAE where the latent space uses tropical (max-plus) algebra
instead of standard linear algebra. This forces the model to learn
discrete, tree-like features natively.

Key insight: In tropical algebra, operations are:
- Addition: max(a, b)
- Multiplication: a + b

This means:
- Linear combinations become piecewise linear (max of linear functions)
- The latent space naturally encodes tree structures
- Geodesics are piecewise linear paths
