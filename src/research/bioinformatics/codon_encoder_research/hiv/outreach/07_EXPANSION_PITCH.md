# Expansion Pitch: "Beyond HIV"

## Subject: Geometric Prediction for [Disease Name] (New Platform capability)

**To:** [Program Officer / Research Lead]

Dear [Name],

Following our success in modeling HIV-1 escape pathways (78% predictive accuracy), the Ternary VAE team has identified **[Target Disease: e.g., Tuberculosis / SARS-CoV-2]** as the next critical target for our geometric landscape analysis.

### Why This Matters for [Disease]

Our "Hyperbolic Codon Encoder" is pathogen-agnostic. It does not look at biological phenotype; it looks at the **mathematical structure of the genetic code itself**.

We believe we can solve specific open problems in your field:

**For Tuberculosis (WHO/Gates):**

- **Problem:** Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR-TB) evolves over months of treatment.
- **Our Solution:** We can calculate the "Geometric Barrier" for new drugs like Bedaquiline and Pretomanid. We can predict which mutations are "mathematically close" and likely to emerge first, guiding combination therapy design.

**For SARS-CoV-2 (GISAID/Hie):**

- **Problem:** Variants of Concern (VoC) like Omicron emerge with "jumps" in sequence space.
- **Our Solution:** In our hyperbolic model, these "jumps" often correspond to geodesic shortcuts. We can map the "Next Geodesic Neighbor" to current strains like JN.1.

### The Proposal

We are looking for a **Data Partnership**.

- **You provde:** Curated resistance phenotypes (e.g., the WHO mutation catalogue).
- **We provide:** The Geometric Risk Score for every possible mutation in the genome.

This would be a pilot project to demonstrate that _p-adic geometry_ is a universal law of viral evolution.

Can we schedule a 20-minute walkthrough of our HIV results to show the potential parallels?

Best regards,

The Ternary VAE Team
