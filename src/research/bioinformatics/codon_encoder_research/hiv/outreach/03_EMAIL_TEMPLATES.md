## Tier 1: Open Allies (MPP, DNDi, Unitaid)

**Subject:** Geometric Prediction of HIV Escape Zones - Open Collaboration

Dear [Name/Team],

We are the Ternary VAE team, an open-source research initiative. We have identified a geometric "Goldilocks Zone" (hyperbolic distance 5.5-6.5) that predicts HIV-1 escape mutations with 78% accuracy, effectively mapping the "path of least resistance" for the virus.

Unlike black-box AI, our method is derived from number theory (p-adic valuation), providing a rigorous mathematical explanation for why certain mutations (like M46I) are evolutionarily favored despite chemical dissimilarity.

**We are releasing this tech as an Open Medicine initiative.**

We believe this predictive capability is a public good. We want to prevent it from being patented into exclusivity. We are looking to partner with [Organization Name] to:

1.  Share our "Hiding Distance Matrix" for your drug discovery projects.
2.  Establish a precedent that viral evolutionary maps are **Prior Art**, keeping them in the public domain.

Attached is our Scientific Whitepaper. We would welcome a call to discuss how we can support your access goals.

Best regards,

The Ternary VAE Team

## Tier 2: Academic Validators (Stanford, Brizuela, Colbes)

**Subject:** Validation Request: p-adic Hyperbolic Embeddings for HIV-1

Dear Professor [Name],

Our team has developed a novel method for embedding the genetic code into a 16-D Poincaré ball using p-adic valuations. Preliminary results on the Stanford HIVDB dataset show a strong correlation (-0.83) between our "Hyperbolic Radial Position" and mutational fitness costs.

**Key Finding:** We observed that 77% of CTL escape mutations cluster in a specific hyperbolic shell ($5.5 < d < 6.5$), which we interpret as an "Optimal Escape Zone".

We are conducting an implementation audit and would value your critique. Specifically, we are looking to cross-reference our geometric "Distance Matrix" against your [Specific Work, e.g., "StarPep Toolbox" or "Stanford Resistance Scores"].

We have attached a brief Whitepaper detailing the methodology. Are you open to a 15-minute review of the core findings?

Sincerely,

The Ternary VAE Team

## Tier 3: Commercial Partners (Pharma R&D)

**Subject:** Predictive Toxicology for HIV Integrase Inhibitors [CONFIDENTIAL]

To the R&D Director,

Our team has developed a geometric toxicological screen that successfully modeled the resistance profile of Dolutegravir (R263K mutation) _purely_ through p-adic codon topology, without needing biological priors.

We are offering non-exclusive commercial licensing of this screening platform. This allows you to **fail candidates early in silico**, rather than in Phase 2 trials.

**The Proposition:**

- **Predict:** Identify "Hidden" resistance pathways (like M46I) that standard screens miss.
- **Validate:** Confirm the Genetic Barrier of your leads (like our DTG validation).

As part of our charter, all licensing includes Global Access provisions for LMICs.

Are you open to a technical demonstration of the resistance surface using a historic target of your choice?

Regards,

The Ternary VAE Team
