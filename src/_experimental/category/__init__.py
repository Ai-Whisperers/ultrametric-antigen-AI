"""Categorical Mathematics Module.

Implements category-theoretic structures for biological modeling:
- Sheaves: Local-to-global data consistency
- Functors: Structure-preserving maps between categories
- Natural Transformations: Maps between functors

Key Applications:
1. Sheaf Theory for Proteins:
   - Local structure (residue properties) -> Global structure (fold)
   - Consistency constraints across overlapping domains
   - Gluing conditions for protein assembly

2. Categorical Semantics:
   - Functors map between different representations
   - Natural transformations capture relationships
   - Limits/colimits for combining data

Mathematical Framework:
A presheaf F on a topological space X assigns:
- To each open set U, an object F(U)
- To each inclusion U ⊆ V, a restriction map F(V) -> F(U)

A sheaf additionally satisfies:
- Locality: If s,t ∈ F(U) agree on a cover, s = t
- Gluing: Compatible local sections glue to global section
