"""Data loading and sampling strategies for training.

This module re-exports data utilities from src/data for backwards compatibility.
The canonical implementations are now in src/data/stratified.py.

For new code, prefer importing directly from src.data:
    from src.data import TernaryDataset, StratifiedBatchSampler, create_stratified_batches
