| Ivan Weiss Van Der Pol | @IvanWeissVanDerPol | Co-Founder / DevEx Lead | Claude Code infrastructure, ecosystem analysis, trust, financial support, time investment, organizational development |
| Kyrian Weiss Van Der Pol | @KyrianWeissVanDerPol | Co-Founder / Organization Member | Trust, support, organizational membership |

---

## Founding Principles

### 1. Permanent Founder Attribution

The three founders listed above shall **always** be recognized as the project founders in:

- All derivative works and spin-offs
- Any commercialization or licensing agreements
- Documentation, publications, and public communications
- Legal filings, patents, or IP registrations

This attribution cannot be removed, transferred, or diminished by any party, including the founders themselves, future contributors, acquirers, or licensees.

### 2. Original IP Authorship

Jonathan Verdun is recognized as the **original intellectual property creator** of the Ternary Engine, having conceived, designed, and implemented the core innovations including:

- Balanced ternary SIMD arithmetic kernel
- TritNet neural network-based arithmetic architecture
- Dense243 encoding system
- Backend dispatch architecture
- Competitive benchmarking methodology

This original authorship is documented in git history and prior blockchain timestamps (2025-11-23, 2025-11-25, 2025-11-28).

### 3. Shared Rights Framework

While Jonathan Verdun holds original IP authorship, this project operates as a **shared venture** where:

- All founders hold perpetual, irrevocable rights to use, develop, and build upon the IP
- All organization members may contribute and gain participation rights
- No single founder can exclude others from the project or its benefits
- The project's value derives from collective contribution, not individual ownership

---

## Profit Participation Commitment

### Binding Commitment

When the Ternary Engine generates revenue through any means (licensing, products, services, acquisitions, or other commercialization), the founders **shall** receive profit participation. This is a binding commitment, not a discretionary option.

### Participants

**Mandatory Profit Participants:**
- Jonathan Verdun (Original Creator)
- Ivan Weiss Van Der Pol (Co-Founder)
- Kyrian Weiss Van Der Pol (Co-Founder)

**Additional Participants:**
- Any Ai-Whisperers organization member may become a profit participant through meaningful contribution, as determined by founder consensus.

### Participation Terms

- Specific percentages and amounts shall be determined by mutual agreement among founders when revenue materializes
- Terms shall recognize both code contributions AND non-code contributions (trust, financial support, time investment, organizational work, infrastructure)
- Terms may be adjusted over time by mutual founder agreement to reflect evolving contributions
- No founder may be excluded from profit participation without their explicit written consent

### Recognition of Non-Code Contributions

This agreement explicitly recognizes that project value derives from more than source code:

- **Trust**: Believing in the project before commercial validation
- **Financial Support**: Investing resources without guaranteed return
- **Time Investment**: Contributing hours to organizational development
- **Infrastructure**: Building systems that enable development (Claude Code, DevEx)
- **Network**: Providing organizational structure and credibility

These contributions are valued equally with code contributions for profit participation purposes.

---

## Continuity & Succession

### Purpose

This section ensures the Ternary Engine project survives beyond any individual founder and can continue generating value for all stakeholders.

### Succession Triggers

If Jonathan Verdun (Original Creator) becomes **unavailable** for a continuous period of six (6) months or more due to:

- Death
- Incapacitation
- Unreachability (no response to documented contact attempts)
- Voluntary withdrawal with written notice

Then succession provisions automatically activate.

### Succession Rights

Upon activation, Ivan Weiss Van Der Pol and Kyrian Weiss Van Der Pol (or surviving co-founders) **jointly inherit**:

1. Full rights to continue development of the Ternary Engine
2. Authority to make architectural and strategic decisions
3. Rights to commercialize, license, or sell the technology
4. Authority to create spin-off projects or companies
5. Rights to admit new contributors and profit participants
6. All privileges previously held by the Original Creator except founder attribution (which remains with Jonathan Verdun in perpetuity)

### Succession Principles

- Successors shall honor all existing profit participation commitments
- Successors shall maintain founder attribution for all three founders
- Successors shall act in good faith to maximize value for all stakeholders
- The project shall not be abandoned if any successor wishes to continue

### Reciprocal Succession

The same succession provisions apply if any co-founder becomes unavailable:

- Their profit participation rights transfer to their legal heirs or designated beneficiaries
- Their founder attribution remains permanent and irrevocable
- Remaining founders continue with full operational authority

---

## Spin-off & Derivative Rights

### Permitted Activities

Any founder or organization member in good standing may:

- Create derivative works based on the Ternary Engine
- Start companies or projects utilizing the technology
- License the technology to third parties (with founder notification)
- Publish research or educational materials

### Obligations

When creating spin-offs or derivatives:

1. **Attribution Required**: All three founders must be credited
2. **Notification Required**: Other founders must be notified of commercial spin-offs
3. **Participation Offered**: Other founders must be offered opportunity to participate
4. **Fair Dealing**: Spin-offs shall not compete unfairly with the main project
5. **License Compliance**: Apache 2.0 terms must be honored
