================================================================================

This project implements balanced ternary arithmetic operations using:
- AVX2 SIMD vectorization for high-performance parallel processing
- Lookup table optimizations for branch-free scalar operations
- Python bindings via pybind11

Key innovations include:
- 2-bit compact trit encoding (0b00=-1, 0b01=0, 0b10=+1)
- Inverted polarity mapping for efficient SIMD operations
- Saturating ternary arithmetic with modulo-3 semantics
