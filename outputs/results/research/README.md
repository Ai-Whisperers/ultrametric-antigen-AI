## Key Discoveries

### 1. Drug Resistance Geometry

**File:** `discoveries/hiv/DISCOVERY_HIV_PADIC_RESISTANCE.md`

Drug classes show distinct geometric signatures in p-adic space:

| Drug Class | Distance | Clinical Implication |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| NRTI | d = 6.05 | Most constrained - backbone therapy |
| NNRTI | d = 5.34 | Moderate constraint |
| INSTI | d = 5.16 | Intermediate |
| PI | d = 3.60 | Most flexible escape |

### 2. Elite Controller Protection

HLA alleles that force HIV into distant escape mutations:

| HLA Allele | Escape Distance | Protection |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| HLA-B*27 | d = 7.38 | Highest |
| HLA-B*57:01 | d = 6.34 | High |
| HLA-A*02:01 | d = 4.89 | Moderate |

### 3. Sentinel Glycans

7 glycosylation sites identified in the "Goldilocks Zone" (15-30% centroid shift):
- N58, N429, N103, N204, N107, N271, N265

### 4. Evolutionary Validation

P-adic distances correlate with evolutionary relationships:
- **Spearman r = 0.8339** between p-adic distance and phylogenetic divergence
