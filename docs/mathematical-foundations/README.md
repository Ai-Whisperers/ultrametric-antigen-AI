## Overview

This directory contains the mathematical theory underlying the Ternary VAE project. The core insight is that biological sequences have inherent **hierarchical structure** that is better captured by **non-Euclidean geometry**.

## Quick Theory Overview

### Why P-adic Numbers?

P-adic numbers measure "closeness" by divisibility rather than magnitude. For the genetic code:

- **Position 1 & 2 mutations**: High impact (high p-adic distance)
- **Position 3 (wobble) mutations**: Low impact (low p-adic distance)

This matches biological reality where synonymous mutations (position 3) are often neutral.

### Why Hyperbolic Geometry?

Hyperbolic space (Poincaré ball) has exponential volume growth, making it ideal for embedding trees:

- **Origin**: Root/ancestor (high valuation, conserved)
- **Boundary**: Leaves/variants (low valuation, diverse)

Euclidean space distorts hierarchies; hyperbolic space preserves them.

### The Connection

| P-adic Structure | Hyperbolic Embedding |
|------------------|----------------------|
| High valuation | Near origin (small radius) |
| Low valuation | Near boundary (large radius) |
| P-adic distance | Hyperbolic distance |
