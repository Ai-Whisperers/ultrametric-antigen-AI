## Executive Summary

**Ultrametric Antigen AI** is a novel AI platform that accelerates drug discovery and pathogen surveillance 300-18,000x faster than physics-based methods.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Speed advantage**: Screen millions of mutations in seconds vs hours/days with FoldX/Rosetta
2. **Novel geometry**: Hyperbolic + p-adic mathematics (no direct competitors)
3. **Complementary detection**: Finds "Rosetta-blind" mutations that physics tools miss (23.6% of cases)
4. **Production ready**: 4 partner packages at 90-95% completion, 101+ passing tests

## Risk Factors & Honest Limitations

We believe transparency builds investor trust:

| Risk | Details | Mitigation |
|:-----|:--------|:-----------|
| **DDG benchmark performance** | Full S669: ρ=0.37-0.40, below ESM-1v (0.51) | Position as fast pre-screen, not replacement |
| **No wet-lab validation** | All results computational | 8 AMP candidates ready for testing; seeking collaborators |
| **Research stage** | No clinical deployment or revenue | Production APIs tested; partner packages validated |
| **Niche approach** | Hyperbolic ML is unfamiliar to most | Emphasize speed/complementary value, not complexity |
