"""Research Proposals for Codon Encoder.

Current proposals:
- HYPERBOLIC_STABILITY_INVARIANTS.md: Train purely hyperbolic model to find
  stability invariants that evolution bypassed in favor of error tolerance.

Background:
- TEGB conjecture falsified (3-adic does not encode thermodynamics)
- Multi-prime conjecture falsified (no prime encodes thermodynamics)
- Discovery: DNA evolved for error tolerance, not thermodynamic optimization

Next step: Abandon p-adic constraints, search in pure hyperbolic space for
the stability invariants that evolution deliberately obfuscated.
