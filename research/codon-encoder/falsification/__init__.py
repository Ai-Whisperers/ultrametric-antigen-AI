"""TEGB Conjecture Falsification Module.

This module contains tests for the Thermodynamical Effects Generalization Bridge
(TEGB) conjecture, which hypothesizes that p-adic codon structure encodes
thermodynamic properties through evolutionary selection.

Key findings (2026-01-03):
- TEGB is FALSIFIED at all 4 tested links
- P-adic structure does NOT predict thermodynamic stability (DDG)
- P-adic features actually HURT prediction when combined with physicochemistry

Implications:
- P-adic is NOT appropriate for DDG prediction
- P-adic may still be useful for: immune escape, evolutionary distance, translation kinetics

Usage:
    python tegb_falsification.py
