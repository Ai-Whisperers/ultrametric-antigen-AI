# Archived Euclidean Results (RA Research)

**Archived:** 2025-12-27

## Why Archived

These results were generated using Euclidean distance metrics for codon analysis. The project has moved to p-adic/hyperbolic geometry which better captures the hierarchical structure of the genetic code.

## Current Results

Use the `hyperbolic/` directory for current p-adic/Poincare-based analysis results.

## Archived Contents

- Codon optimization plots (COL2A1, FN1, HAS2, PRG4)
- HLA analysis (expanded, functionomic)
- Citrullination analysis
- Autoantigen p-adic analysis
- Regenerative axis analysis

These remain for historical comparison but should not be used for new research.
