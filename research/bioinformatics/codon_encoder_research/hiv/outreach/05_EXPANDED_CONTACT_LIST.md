# Expanded Contact List: Global Health & Platform Expansion

## Tier 4: Global Health Philanthropy & Policy

_Focus: Scaling the impact to other diseases (TB, Malaria) and ensuring access._

### 1. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)

- **Target:** "Global Health: HIV" or "Global Health: Tuberculosis" program officers.
- **Why:** They fund the largest TB/HIV databanks. They will care about the _Predictive_ aspect for vaccine design.
- **Contact Strategy:**
  - Look for "Senior Program Officer, Discovery & Translational Sciences".
  - Website: [gatesfoundation.org](https://www.gatesfoundation.org)

### 2. Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)

- **Target:** Global Markets Team / Viral Hepatitis & HIV.
- **Why:** CHAI negotiates pricing for generic drugs. Our "Tiered Pricing" clause aligns perfectly with their mission.
- **Contact:** `press@clintonhealthaccess.org` (Ask for the Global Markets team).

### 3. WHO Global Tuberculosis Programme (GTB)

- **Target:** Technical Officer, Laboratories & Diagnostics.
- **Why:** They maintain the "WHO TB Mutation Catalogue". Our platform can _automate_ the expansion of this catalogue.
- **Website:** [who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme](https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme)

## Tier 5: Computational Biology & Tech Allies

_Focus: Scientific validation and "Generative Biology" partnerships._

### 4. Prof. Brian Hie (Stanford / Inceptive)

- **Why:** He wrote the seminal paper on "Learning the language of viral evolution" (Science, 2021).
- **Alignment:** He uses language models; we use _geometric_ models. It's a perfect complementary approach.
- **Contact:** Look for his lab at Stanford or his startup "Inceptive".

### 5. GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data)

- **Why:** They hold the world's COVID and Flu data.
- **Goal:** Offer our geometric embeddings as a "Plug-in" for their visualization dashboard.
- **Contact:** `info@gisaid.org`

### 6. DeepMind / Isomorphic Labs

- **Why:** We use AlphaFold. We are essentially doing "AlphaFold for Evolution".
- **Target:** "Academic Partnerships" or "Research Scientist, Protein Design".

## Tier 6: Cross-Disease Academic Leads

_From our Expansion Candidates analysis._

### 7. Tuberculosis: The CRyPTIC Consortium

- **Focus:** Comprehensive Resistance Prediction for Tuberculosis.
- **Why:** They have the largest dataset of TB genomes + phenotypes.
- **Contact:** Dr. Philip Fowler (Oxford) or Dr. Timothy Walker.

### 8. Malaria: MalariaGEN

- **Focus:** Plasmodium genomic epidemiology.
- **Why:** We can map Artemisinin resistance (K13) geometrically.
- **Website:** [malariagen.net](https://www.malariagen.net)
