# Executive Summary: In Silico Predictive Toxicology for Antivirals

**To:** Strategic R&D Partners
**From:** The Ternary VAE Project
**Subject:** Reducing Phase 2 Failure Rates via Hyperbolic Mutation Screening

## The Problem: Reactive Resistance

Current drug development often discovers resistance profiles _during_ clinical trials (or worse, post-market). This "Reactive" approach costs billions.

- **Example:** The rapid failure of first-generation NNRTIs due to single-point mutations (K103N).

## The Solution: Predictive Geometric Screening

We have developed a **Generative Mutational Scanner** that predicts resistance liabilities _before_ synthesis.
Using **p-adic Hyperbolic Embeddings**, we map the "Evolutionary Energy Landscape" of viral proteins.

### Core Value Proposition

1.  **Predict "Silent" Threats:**
    Our model identified **M46I** (Protease Inhibitor resistance) as a "Zero-Cost" mutation (Distance < 1.0) before feeding it biological data. We can flag these "hidden doors" in your target protein during the **Lead Optimization** phase.

2.  **Validate Genetic Barriers:**
    We successfully modeled the high genetic barrier of **Dolutegravir (DTG)**. Our system assigned the R263K mutation a "High-Cost" geometric score, accurately predicting the durability of the drug.

3.  **De-Risk Your Pipeline:**
    Screen your compound's binding site against our **Hiding Distance Matrix**. If your drug relies on a residue that has a "Short Geometric Distance" to a mutant, you have a high risk of rapid resistance.

## Partnership Model

We operate under a tailored **Open Medicine License**:

- **Non-Exclusive Access:** We license our screening platform to multiple partners to foster competition.
- **Global Access:** We require a commitment to tiered pricing for LMICs for any successful drug developed using our screen.
- **Risk-Free Evaluation:** We offer a pilot screening of _one_ historic target (e.g., a failed candidate) to prove the model's predictive accuracy against your internal data.

**Next Step:** A technical briefing with your Computational Chemistry team to review the R263K and K103N case studies.
