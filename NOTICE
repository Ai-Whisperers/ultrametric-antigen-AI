2. AlphaFold3 Server Predictions (VALIDATION ONLY)

   Data in research/bioinformatics/codon_encoder_research/*/alphafold3_predictions/
   was generated using the AlphaFold Server (https://alphafoldserver.com).

   PURPOSE: These predictions are used to VALIDATE our independent findings,
   not to generate them. Our research conclusions are derived from our own
   Ternary VAE methodology.

   Subject to AlphaFold Server Terms of Service.
