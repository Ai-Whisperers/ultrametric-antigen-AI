## PURPOSE

This folder documents the intellectual property that constitutes our core competitive advantage. It provides:

1. **IP Inventory** - Complete list of protectable innovations
2. **Safe Language** - Approved terminology for external communication
3. **Claim Boundaries** - Patent scope and prior art positioning
4. **Disclosure Matrix** - What can be shared at each tier
5. **Forbidden Terms** - Language that must NEVER appear externally

---

## CRITICAL WARNING

**NEVER** share any file from this folder externally.

The value of this IP depends on:
- The **connection** between concepts (not individual concepts)
- The **specific implementation** choices
- The **training methodology** and data pipeline
- The **architectural decisions** that enable the approach

Competitors who learn ANY of these connections could potentially replicate.
