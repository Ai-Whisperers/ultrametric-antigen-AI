# Project Roadmap – Ternary VAE Bioinformatics

## Vision (2025‑2026)

- **Q4 2025**: Finalize core hyperbolic & 3‑adic embedding pipeline, publish open‑source code under PolyForm Non‑Commercial.
- **Q1 2026**: Release first set of pretrained model weights (CC‑BY‑4.0) and benchmark suite.
- **Q2 2026**: Publish open‑access manuscript on geometric vaccine design.
- **Q3‑Q4 2026**: Expand to agricultural applications (Pasteur Molecule‑Binding) and integrate with external datasets.

## Quarterly Milestones

| Quarter     | Target                   | Deliverable                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2025 Q4** | Core model stabilization | `v5.12` release, SPDX headers added, CI linting for licensing.              |
| **2026 Q1** | Results package          | `RESULTS_LICENSE.md`, model checkpoints, benchmark report.                  |
| **2026 Q2** | Publication & outreach   | Pre‑print on arXiv, conference poster, open‑medicine policy dissemination.  |
| **2026 Q3** | Agricultural pilot       | Proof‑of‑concept for cattle parasite drug discovery.                        |
| **2026 Q4** | Community growth         | Contributor onboarding guide, CLA integration, open‑source community forum. |

## Dependencies & Gateways

- **Risk Register** (see `RISK_REGISTER.md`) must be reviewed before each quarterly checkpoint.
- **Code Health Metrics** must show ≤ 5 % new critical lint issues before any release.
- **Open‑Medicine Policy** must be referenced in all public releases.
