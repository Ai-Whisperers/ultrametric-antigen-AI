# Project Milestones – Ternary VAE Bioinformatics

## Milestone Structure

Each milestone aligns with a quarterly target from the **Roadmap** and includes concrete deliverables, owners, and success criteria.

## Dependencies

- Each milestone must reference the **Risk Register** (`RISK_REGISTER.md`) to ensure mitigation actions are in place before execution.
- **Code Health Metrics** must be reviewed at the start of each quarter to confirm the codebase is within acceptable quality thresholds.
- The **Open‑Medicine Policy** must be cited in all public releases and publications.
