# Idea: The "Geo-Bio" Standard Library

**Status:** Concept
**Driver:** Duplication of math across visualization logic and model logic.

## Concept

Create a rigorous, tested library for the project's core mathematical "secret sauce".

## Modules

- [ ] **`src.geometry.mobius`**: Robust Mobius addition/multiplication (wrapping `geoopt`).
- [ ] **`src.geometry.calabi`**: The Calabi-Yau projection logic (currently dispersed in scripts).
- [ ] **`src.bio.codons`**: Canonical genetic code mappings (currently in `natural_positions.py`).
