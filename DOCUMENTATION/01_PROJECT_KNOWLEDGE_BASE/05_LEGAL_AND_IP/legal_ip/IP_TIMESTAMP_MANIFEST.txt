COVERED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:
------------------------------

1. ARCHITECTURE INNOVATIONS
   - Dual VAE system with frozen coverage + trainable structure
   - Hyperbolic projection layer with separate direction/radius networks
   - DualHyperbolicProjection for independent VAE-A/VAE-B projections
   - Adaptive curriculum with tau freezing at hierarchy threshold
   - Frozen encoder architecture guaranteeing 100% coverage

2. LOSS FUNCTIONS
   - GlobalRankLoss: Differentiable rank ordering for monotonic radius
   - PAdicGeodesicLoss: Unified hierarchy + correlation via geodesics
   - RadialHierarchyLoss: Direct radius enforcement with margin loss
   - Stratified sampling for rare high-valuation points
   - HomeostaticHyperbolicPrior: Self-regulating prior distribution

3. TRAINED MODEL WEIGHTS
   - Projection layer: 53,154 parameters achieving -0.730 hierarchy
   - Encoder B fine-tuned weights
   - Checkpoint: sandbox-training/checkpoints/v5_11_structural/best.pt
   - All .pt/.pth checkpoint files in results/checkpoints/

4. VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
   - Downstream validation suite (nearest-neighbor, hierarchy, arithmetic)
   - Production readiness thresholds and benchmarks
   - Quality metrics: 92.4% pairwise accuracy, 94.7% NN adjacent rate

5. KEY SOURCE FILES
   - src/models/ternary_vae.py
   - src/models/hyperbolic_projection.py
   - src/losses/padic_geodesic.py

6. BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH (UPDATED 2025-12-24)
   - HIV Glycan Shield Sentinel Analysis
     * research/bioinformatics/codon_encoder_research/hiv/glycan_shield/
     * Sentinel residue identification for CD4/gp120 binding
     * Glycan perturbation vulnerability mapping

   - HIV Complete Hiding Landscape
     * 7 validated disruptive conjectures for HIV immune evasion
     * Integrase vulnerability analysis
     * P-adic geometric analysis of HIV-1

   - AlphaFold3 Hybrid Approach
     * 6300x storage reduction methodology
     * Batch job manifest generation
     * Integrase structural validation pipeline

7. TIERED DISCLOSURE STRATEGY (REORGANIZED 2025-12-24)
   - DOCUMENTATION/03_PRESENTATION_TIERS/01_TIER_1_PUBLIC/
     * Public pitch materials, validation protocols, sequences
   - DOCUMENTATION/03_PRESENTATION_TIERS/02_TIER_2_INVESTOR/
     * Claims, proof, contact information for serious inquiries
   - Tier 3 (INTERNAL ONLY - not in repository)
     * IP inventory, competitive moat, forbidden terms
     * NEVER committed to git, kept locally only

8. RESEARCH INSIGHTS (REORGANIZED)
   - DOCUMENTATION/01_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/insights/
   - Anton Petrov video analysis for research directions
   - Connection ideas and implementation strategies
   - External dataset and resource compilation

9. LEGAL AND IP DOCUMENTATION
   - DOCUMENTATION/01_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/05_LEGAL_AND_IP/
   - IP protection action plans
   - Security audit documentation
   - OpenTimestamps blockchain proofs

CLAIMS:
-------
This timestamp proves that the above intellectual property existed
in this form at the time the OpenTimestamps proof was created.

The cryptographic hash of this commit covers all files in the
repository, providing tamper-evident proof of existence.

HASH VERIFICATION:
------------------
To verify this timestamp covers the repository state:
1. Clone repository at commit f8be1eee2f09d369557d430ad67bdd9565a4368c
2. Verify SHA-256 of this manifest matches the timestamped hash
3. Use `ots verify` on the .ots proof file
