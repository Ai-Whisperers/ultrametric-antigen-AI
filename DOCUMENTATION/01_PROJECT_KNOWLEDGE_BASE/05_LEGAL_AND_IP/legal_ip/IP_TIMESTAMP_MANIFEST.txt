=====================================================

Repository: ternary-vaes
Version: V5.12.0 (Restructured)
Tag: v1.2.0

Git Commit: 1b8bfbd03ee6939b533a2970a24eac2b6c2d50ad
Timestamp Date: 2025-12-23

COVERED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:
------------------------------

1. ARCHITECTURE INNOVATIONS
   - Dual VAE system with frozen coverage + trainable structure
   - Hyperbolic projection layer with separate direction/radius networks
   - DualHyperbolicProjection for independent VAE-A/VAE-B projections
   - Adaptive curriculum with tau freezing at hierarchy threshold

2. LOSS FUNCTIONS
   - GlobalRankLoss: Differentiable rank ordering for monotonic radius
   - PAdicGeodesicLoss: Unified hierarchy + correlation via geodesics
   - RadialHierarchyLoss: Direct radius enforcement with margin loss
   - Stratified sampling for rare high-valuation points

3. TRAINED MODEL WEIGHTS
   - Projection layer: 53,154 parameters achieving -0.730 hierarchy
   - Encoder B fine-tuned weights
   - Checkpoint: sandbox-training/checkpoints/v5_11_structural/best.pt

4. VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
   - Downstream validation suite (nearest-neighbor, hierarchy, arithmetic)
   - Production readiness thresholds and benchmarks
   - Quality metrics: 92.4% pairwise accuracy, 94.7% NN adjacent rate

5. KEY SOURCE FILES
   - src/models/ternary_vae.py
   - src/models/hyperbolic_projection.py
   - src/losses/padic_geodesic.py
   - scripts/train/train.py
   - scripts/eval/downstream_validation.py

6. BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH
   - research/bioinformatics/codon_encoder_research/hiv/ (glycan shield analysis)
   - research/bioinformatics/p-adic-genomics/ (p-adic sequence analysis)
   - research/bioinformatics/genetic_code/ (codon encoding research)
   - AlphaFold3 predictions and validation data

CLAIMS:
-------
This timestamp proves that the above intellectual property existed
in this form at the time the OpenTimestamps proof was created.

The cryptographic hash of this commit covers all files in the
repository, providing tamper-evident proof of existence.

HASH VERIFICATION:
------------------
To verify this timestamp covers the repository state:
1. Clone repository at commit 1b8bfbd03ee6939b533a2970a24eac2b6c2d50ad
2. Verify SHA-256 of this manifest matches the timestamped hash
3. Use `ots verify` on the .ots proof file

=====================================================
SHA-256 of git commit tree will be timestamped via OpenTimestamps
Bitcoin blockchain anchoring provides decentralized proof-of-existence
