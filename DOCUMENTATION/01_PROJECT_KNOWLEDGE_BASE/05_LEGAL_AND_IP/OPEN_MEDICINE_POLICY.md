# Open Medicine Policy

## Purpose

We commit to making **all scientific findings, data, model weights, and software outputs** generated by the Ternary VAE project openly available to the global research community. The goal is to accelerate drug discovery for neglected diseases and to prevent any private entity from commercialising our results without a transparent, fair‑use licensing agreement.

## Scope

- **Research results** (tables, figures, statistical analyses, manuscript drafts) – must be released under a **CC‑BY‑4.0** license.
- **Model weights and checkpoints** – covered by the same CC‑BY‑4.0 license (see `RESULTS_LICENSE.md`).
- **Datasets** generated by the pipeline – released under **CC0** where possible, otherwise under CC‑BY‑4.0 with attribution.
- **Software code** – remains under the existing PolyForm Non‑Commercial license for the source, but any _derived scientific outputs_ are governed by this Open Medicine policy.

## Restrictions on Commercial Exploitation

1. **No exclusive licensing** – any party (including pharmaceutical companies) may not obtain an exclusive right to use, sell, or distribute the results.
2. **Mandatory attribution** – any reuse must retain the original authorship and citation (see the BibTeX entry in `LICENSE`).
3. **Commercial use requires a separate agreement** – if a company wishes to commercialise a product based on our findings, they must negotiate a **fair‑use license** with the project maintainers (contact `support@aiwhisperers.com`).
4. **Redistribution** – downstream redistributions must include the full CC‑BY‑4.0 text and a link to this policy.

## Enforcement

- All repository contributors must sign the CLA confirming they agree to this policy.
- Any breach will be addressed under the terms of the PolyForm license and applicable copyright law.
