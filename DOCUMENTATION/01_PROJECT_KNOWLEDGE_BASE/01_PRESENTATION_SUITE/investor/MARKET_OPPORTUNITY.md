# Market Opportunity: Generative Biology

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**$85 Billion by 2030** (Source: McKinsey, TechBio Reports)

- Intersect of AI Drug Discovery, Synthetic Biology, and Bio-Manufacturing.

## Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

**$12 Billion**

- **Focus**: Pre-clinical protein design and viral surveillance.
- **Target Clients**: Top 20 Pharma (Pfizer, Roche), AgBio (Bayer), and Government Defense (DARPA/BARDA).

## Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**$200 Million (Year 1-3)**

- **Launch Niche**: "Difficult-to-drug" targets where structural methods (AlphaFold) fail.
- **Revenue Model**:
  - **SaaS License**: $500k/year per seat for the software.
  - **Milestone Payments**: $10M-$100M per successful drug candidate.

## Why Now?

1.  **Data Explosion**: GISAID has >15M viral sequences. We finally have enough data to train "Foundation Models".
2.  **Compute Shift**: The move from massive Transformers (expensive) to efficient Geometric Deep Learning (cheap) aligns with enterprise cost-cutting.
3.  **Regulatory Pressure**: FDA is demanding "Explainable AI". Our StateNet architecture offers auditability that black-box LLMs cannot.
