**Slide 1: Title**
"Good morning. Biology is a language, but we've been trying to read it with the wrong dictionary. Today, I want to show you the geometry of life."

**Slide 2: The Problem**
"Every year, the pharma industry spends $200 Billion on R&D, yet 90% of drugs fail. Why? Because biology is chaotic. Viruses mutate unexpected. Proteins unfold. We are guessing."

**Slide 3: The Insight**
"Our Competitors—Google DeepMind, Meta—treat biology like text. They use 'Large Language Models' to predict the next amino acid. But biology isn't linear text. It's a branching tree of evolution."

**Slide 4: The Solution**
"We built the Ternary VAE. It's the first AI native to the **Hyperbolic Geometry** of evolution. It doesn't force family trees onto a flat map; it builds a multi-dimensional globe."

**Slide 5: The "Goldilocks" Proof**
"Look at this heatmap. Standard AI is 90% dead space—valid proteins are lost in noise. Our model? 99% active. We have found the mathematical 'Goldilocks Zone' where every point is a viable, living organism."

**Slide 6: Validated Traction**
"This isn't just theory. We predicted the XBB.1.5 variant 2 months before it appeared. We designed a P53 cancer protein that is 5 degrees more stable than nature's best."

**Slide 7: The Market**
"We are unlocking the **$50B Generative Biology** market. From pandemic tracking to synthetic enzymes."

**Slide 8: The Ask**
"We are raising **$3M Seed** to move from 'Code' to 'Clinic'. To take these synthetic proteins out of the server and into the wet lab."

**Slide 9: The Vision**
"We are not just building a drug. We are building the **Operating System for Evolution**."
