# Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) Resources

This document outlines key datasets and resources focused on Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) and bioactive peptides, heavily utilized in recent research for machine learning and structural modeling (e.g., work by Carlos Brizuela and collaborators).

## Primary Datasets

### 1. StarPepDB
*   **Description:** A comprehensive graph-based data integration from over 40 bioactive peptide databases. It is currently recognized as one of the largest experimentally validated, non-redundant peptide datasets available.
*   **Applications:** Used for training alignment-free predictors, molecular encoding, and visual graph mining of the chemical space of bioactive peptides.
*   **Key Feature:** Integrates metadata and structural information across multiple sources into a unified graph structure.

### 2. APD3 (The Antimicrobial Peptide Database)
*   **Description:** A classic, curated database for AMPs with detailed structural and functional information.
*   **Focus:** Natural AMPs with experimentally determined antimicrobial activity.

### 3. CAMP (Collection of Anti-Microbial Peptides)
*   **Description:** Provides information on sequences and structures of antimicrobial peptides.
*   **Focus:** Includes both experimental and predicted AMP sequences.

### 4. DBAASP (Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides)
*   **Description:** A resource that includes chemical structures and activities of AMPs.
*   **Focus:** Detailed activity data against specific strains, including synthetic and modified peptides.

## Research Context
These resources are critical for developing:
*   **Alignment-Free Predictors:** ML models that bypass traditional sequence alignment to predict function.
*   **Molecular Similarity Networks:** Tools for unsupervised learning and visual exploration of peptide chemical space.
*   **Feature Identification:** Discovering relevant structural features for polypharmacologic human-target antimicrobials.
