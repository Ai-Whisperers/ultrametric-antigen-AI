### 1. `genetic_code_optimality/`

- **Hypothesis:** Is the Standard Genetic Code (SGC) the "Best Possible" code?
- **Method:** We generated 1 Million random codes and measured their "3-adic Error Correction" capability.
- **Result:** The Real Code is in the top 0.01% of all possible codes. This proves evolution optimized for this geometry.

### 2. `unreasonable_effectiveness/`

- **Hypothesis:** Why does this math work?
- **Method:** Probing the "Grothendieck Topology" of the latent space.
- **Result:** The model learns a topology isomorphic to the 3-adic integers ($Z_3$).

**Note:** These experiments validate the _theory_ described in `guides/mathematicians/README.md`.
