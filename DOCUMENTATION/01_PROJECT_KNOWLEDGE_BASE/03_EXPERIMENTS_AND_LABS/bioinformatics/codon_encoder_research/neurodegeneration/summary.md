# Neurodegeneration & Prion-like Mechanisms

**Status**: Early Stage
**Codebase**: `research/bioinformatics/codon_encoder_research/neurodegeneration/`

## Overview

Investigating the structural overlaps between viral amyloidogenesis and neurodegenerative plaques (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's).

## Hypothesis

Ternary VAEs can detect "prion-prone" motifs in the latent space that are invisible to standard sequence alignment tools.
