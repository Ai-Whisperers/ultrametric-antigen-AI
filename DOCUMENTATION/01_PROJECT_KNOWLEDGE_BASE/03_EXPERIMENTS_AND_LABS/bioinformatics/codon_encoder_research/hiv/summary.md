# HIV Codon Optimization Research

**Status**: Active Research
**Codebase**: `research/bioinformatics/codon_encoder_research/hiv/`

## Overview

This research stream investigates how HIV utilizes codon optimization to evade immune detection. We analyze the "Glycan Shield" and "Sentinel Glycans" to understand how the virus maintains fitness while hiding from neutralizing antibodies.

## Key Components

- **Sentinel Glycan Analysis**: Identifying geometric constraints on glycan placement.
- **Drug Resistance**: Mapping evolutionary paths for Integrase inhibitors.
- **Goldilocks Zone**: Statistical analysis of "just right" binding affinities for viral persistence.

## Replication

To run the analysis:

```bash
python research/bioinformatics/codon_encoder_research/hiv/reproduce_hiv_analysis.ps1
```
