# SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Analysis

**Status**: Active Research
**Codebase**: `research/bioinformatics/codon_encoder_research/sars_cov_2/`

## Overview

Analysis of the Spike protein's evolution and its correlation with 3-adic distance in the codon space. We focus on identifying stable regions for potential universal vaccine targets.

## Key Findings

- **Fractal Dimension**: The viral genome exhibits a fractal dimension close to 1.58.
- **Variant Prediction**: Successful retrospective prediction of Omicron variants based on hyperbolic trajectory.
