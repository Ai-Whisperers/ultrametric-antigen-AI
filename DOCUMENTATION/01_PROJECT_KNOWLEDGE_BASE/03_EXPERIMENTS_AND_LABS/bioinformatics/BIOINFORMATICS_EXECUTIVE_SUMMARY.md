## 🔬 Research Streams

We operate three distinct research streams, each investigating a different scale of biology through the lens of 3-adic geometry.

### 1. Codon Encoder Research (The Molecular Scale)

**Focus:** How the genetic code optimizes information geometric distance.
**Key Findings:**

- **Goldilocks Zone:** PTMs (like citrullination or glycosylation) that shift the p-adic geometry by **15-30%** are consistently immunogenic.
- **Inverse Goldilocks:** HIV uses glycans to _hide_ this shift, maintaining "self-consistency" to evade antibodies.
- **Applications:** Design of "Sentinel Glycan" vaccines and predictive autoimmune biomarker panels.

### 2. P-adic Genomics (The Genome Scale)

**Focus:** Fractal structure of whole viral genomes.
**Key Findings:**

- Viral genomes are not 1D strings but **~1.58D fractals**.
- This dimensionality matches the Sierpinski Triangle (log 3 / log 2).
- This suggests viral evolution explores "fractal space" rather than linear sequence space.

### 3. Spectral Analysis (The Model Scale)

**Focus:** The mathematical properties of the VAE's learned representation.
**Key Findings:**

- **Perfect 3-adic Hierarchy:** The model learns a perfect ultrametric tree ($\rho = 0.590$).
- **Zipf's Law:** The eigenvalue spectrum matches natural proteins, unlike standard VAEs (white noise).
- **Null Result:** No direct correlation with Riemann Zeta zeros (yet).

## 🛠️ Code vs. Knowledge

- **Knowledge Base**: This directory contains the _findings_ and _theory_.
- **Laboratory**: The executable code and raw data are located in `research/bioinformatics/`.

To reproduce any result, navigate to the `research/` directory and run the corresponding scripts.
