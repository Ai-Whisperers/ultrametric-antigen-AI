# Hyperbolic Cosmology Analogy

## Objective

Apply black hole topology concepts to improve Poincare ball embeddings.

## Theoretical Framework

Based on "Do We Actually Live Inside a Black Hole?" video:

- Event horizon geometry is analogous to Poincare ball boundary
- Information preservation at horizons may inform our boundary handling
- Holographic principles could improve latent space interpretation

## Implementation Direction

```python
# Proposed enhancement: src/geometry/holographic_poincare.py

class HolographicPoincareManifold:
    """
    Apply holographic principle to Poincare embeddings.

    Key insight: Information near boundary encodes bulk properties.
    """

    def boundary_encoding(self, latent_vector):
        """
        Project to boundary while preserving information.
        """
        pass

    def bulk_reconstruction(self, boundary_data):
        """
        Reconstruct latent space from boundary encoding.
        """
        pass
```
