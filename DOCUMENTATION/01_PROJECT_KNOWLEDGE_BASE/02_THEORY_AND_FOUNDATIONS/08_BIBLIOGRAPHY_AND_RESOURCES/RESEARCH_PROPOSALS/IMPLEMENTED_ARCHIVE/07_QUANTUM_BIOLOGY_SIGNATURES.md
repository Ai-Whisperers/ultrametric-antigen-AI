# Quantum Biology Module

## Objective

Investigate p-adic signatures in enzyme catalytic sites (inspired by quantum time video).

## Implementation Ideas

```python
# Proposed module: src/analysis/quantum_biology.py

class QuantumBiologyAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyze p-adic patterns in quantum-active biological sites.

    Hypothesis: Quantum tunneling sites have distinct p-adic signatures.
    """

    QUANTUM_ENZYMES = [
        'photosystem_II',
        'cytochrome_c_oxidase',
        'aromatic_amine_dehydrogenase',
        'soybean_lipoxygenase'
    ]

    def analyze_catalytic_site(self, enzyme_sequence, active_site_residues):
        """
        Calculate p-adic clustering of catalytic site residues.
        """
        pass

    def predict_tunneling_probability(self, site_padic_signature):
        """
        Correlate p-adic signature with tunneling efficiency.
        """
        pass
```

## Expected Outcome

- Novel connection between p-adic geometry and quantum biology
- Potential for predicting enzyme efficiency from sequence
