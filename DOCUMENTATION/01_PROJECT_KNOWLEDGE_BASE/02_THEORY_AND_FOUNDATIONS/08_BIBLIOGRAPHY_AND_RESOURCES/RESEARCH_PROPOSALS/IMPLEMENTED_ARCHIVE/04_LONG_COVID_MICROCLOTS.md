# Long COVID Disease Domain

## Objective

Apply p-adic framework to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein PTMs and microclot formation.

## Implementation Steps

```python
# Proposed module: src/diseases/long_covid.py

class LongCOVIDAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyze spike protein modifications in long COVID.
    """

    def __init__(self, padic_encoder, goldilocks_detector):
        self.encoder = padic_encoder
        self.goldilocks = goldilocks_detector

    def analyze_spike_ptms(self, spike_sequence, ptm_sites):
        """
        Calculate p-adic shifts for each spike protein PTM.

        Returns:
            - PTM site p-adic distances
            - Goldilocks Zone classification
            - Predicted immunogenicity
        """
        pass

    def compare_variants(self, variant_sequences):
        """
        Compare p-adic profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants.
        """
        pass

    def predict_chronic_immune_activation(self, ptm_profile):
        """
        Predict likelihood of chronic immune response.
        """
        pass
```

## Data Sources

- GISAID SARS-CoV-2 sequences
- Published microclot protein composition
- Long COVID patient PTM data (if available)

## Expected Outcome

- P-adic explanation for long COVID persistence
- Potential therapeutic targets based on Goldilocks Zone analysis
