## Abstract

People living with HIV (PLWH) experience earlier onset of aging-related comorbidities compared to their counterparts without HIV. This review proposes a neuroimmune feedback model explaining accelerated aging and chronic inflammation in PLWH.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Accelerated Aging**: Earlier onset of age-related diseases
- **Inflamm-aging**: Chronic inflammation associated with aging
- **Neuroimmune Feedback**: Cyclical interaction between nervous and immune systems
- **Comorbidities**: Diseases occurring alongside HIV

## The Neuroimmune Feedback Model

> "Repeated cycling of neuroimmune feedback loops leads to increases in systemic inflammation over time, which accelerates the pathogenesis of aging-related comorbidities."

### Key Comorbidities Affected
| System | Conditions |
|:-------|:-----------|
| Cardiovascular | Coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy |
| Metabolic | Type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia |
| Neurological | HAND, cognitive impairment |
| Musculoskeletal | Frailty, osteoporosis |
| Renal | Chronic kidney disease |

---

## Mechanisms of Accelerated Aging

### 1. Chronic Inflammation
- Persistent immune activation despite viral suppression
- Elevated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6)
- Failure to resolve gut barrier dysfunction

### 2. Immunosenescence
- Premature aging of immune cells
- CD4+ T cell dysfunction
- Reduced immune repertoire

### 3. ART-Related Toxicity
| Drug Class | Toxicity |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Older NRTIs (stavudine, zidovudine) | Mitochondrial toxicity |
| Protease inhibitors | Dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, lipodystrophy |

### 4. Gut Microbiome Alterations
- Intestinal microbial translocation
- Altered microbiome composition
- Chronic immune activation

## Demographic Impact

> "Due to cART's effectiveness in extending life expectancy, over half of the people with HIV in the US are now over 50, with this number projected to reach 70% by 2030."

---

## Clinical Implications

1. **Screening**: Prioritize young PLWH for comorbidity screening
2. **Prevention**: Primary prevention strategies essential
3. **Collaboration**: Interdisciplinary care (cardiology, nephrology, etc.)
4. **Monitoring**: Regular assessment for aging-related conditions

## Research Directions

| Area | Focus |
|:-----|:------|
| Biomarkers | Aging and inflammation markers |
| Interventions | Anti-inflammatory therapies |
| Lifestyle | Exercise, nutrition impacts |
| Drug optimization | Minimizing ART toxicity |

## Relevance to Project

Understanding HIV-related aging informs:
- Long-term sequence evolution in treated populations
- Selection pressures beyond antiviral resistance
- Biological validation of computational models
- Clinical context for therapeutic development
