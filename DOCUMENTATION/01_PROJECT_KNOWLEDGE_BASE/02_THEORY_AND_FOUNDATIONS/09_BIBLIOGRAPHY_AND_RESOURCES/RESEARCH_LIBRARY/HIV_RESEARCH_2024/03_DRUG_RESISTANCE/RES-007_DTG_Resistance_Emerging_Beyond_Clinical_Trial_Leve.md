## Abstract

Real-world surveillance data from 2024 reveals that HIV drug resistance to dolutegravir (DTG) is emerging at levels significantly exceeding clinical trial observations. While DTG maintains >90% viral suppression rates, resistance prevalence ranges from 3.9% to 19.6% in individuals without viral suppression, particularly among heavily treatment-experienced patients switched to DTG with high viral loads.

## Key Concepts

- **Dolutegravir (DTG)**: Second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)
- **Treatment-emergent resistance**: Resistance developing during therapy
- **Acquired resistance**: Mutations selected under drug pressure
- **Real-world data**: Observational data from clinical practice (vs. controlled trials)

## Resistance Prevalence Data

### WHO 2024 Survey Results
| Population | DTG Resistance Rate |
|:-----------|:--------------------|
| Standard surveys (range) | 3.9% - 8.6% |
| Treatment-experienced + high VL at switch | **Up to 19.6%** |
| Clinical trial expectations | <2% |

### South Africa Projections
| Year | Projected DTG Resistance |
|:-----|:-------------------------|
| 2023 | 18% |
| 2035 (without mitigation) | **42%** |

## Key Resistance Mutations

### Primary DTG Resistance Mutations
| Mutation | Position | Effect |
|:---------|:---------|:-------|
| G118R | Integrase | High-level resistance |
| E138K | Integrase | Intermediate resistance |
| Q148H/K/R | Integrase | High-level (requires accessory) |
| N155H | Integrase | Low-level DTG, higher for RAL |
| R263K | Integrase | Moderate resistance |
| G140A/C/R/S | Integrase | Accessory mutations |

### Mutation Patterns
- Often seen in **heavily treatment-experienced** individuals
- Common in those with **prior INSTI exposure**
- Multiple mutations may **accumulate** over time

---

## Clinical Context

### Despite Resistance, DTG Remains Highly Effective
| Metric | Finding |
|:-------|:--------|
| Overall viral suppression | >90% in adherent patients |
| WHO recommendation | First-line ART worldwide |
| Barrier to resistance | Highest among INSTIs |
| Clinical failures | Relatively rare |

### Risk Factors for Resistance
1. **High viral load at switch** to DTG-containing regimen
2. **Heavy prior treatment experience**
3. **Poor adherence** to ART
4. **Previous INSTI exposure** (raltegravir, elvitegravir)

## Expert Commentary

> "The worrying evidence of resistance in individuals with unsuppressed viral load despite dolutegravir treatment underscores the necessity for increased vigilance and intensified efforts to optimize the quality of HIV care delivery."
> — Dr. Meg Doherty, WHO

## Public Health Implications

### Recommendations
| Action | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| Viral load monitoring | Detect failure early |
| Resistance testing | Guide regimen switches |
| Adherence support | Prevent resistance emergence |
| Differentiated care | Optimize service delivery |

### Global Concerns
- **Millions in Africa** rely on DTG as first-line treatment
- **Limited second-line options** if DTG resistance spreads
- **Surveillance gaps** in low/middle-income countries

## Real-World Data Sources

### PEPFAR-Supported Studies (4 LMICs)
| Setting | DTG Resistance |
|:--------|:---------------|
| Viremic patients on ART ≥9 months | 3.9% |
| Treatment-experienced switchers | Up to 19.6% |

### Mozambique Cohort (2025)
| Metric | Finding |
|:-------|:--------|
| Patients on DTG | 29,601 (98.1%) |
| Viral suppression | 95% |
| Resistance tests with major mutations | 8/17 (47%) |

## Relevance to Project

DTG resistance data informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Integrase mutations**: Training data for resistance prediction
- **Mutation patterns**: Understanding combinatorial effects
- **Selection pressure**: Modeling evolutionary trajectories
- **Clinical outcomes**: Validating prediction models
