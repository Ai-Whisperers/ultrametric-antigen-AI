## Abstract

The "Geneva patient" represents a groundbreaking case in HIV cure research—the first person to achieve sustained HIV remission following a stem cell transplant without the donor having the protective CCR5Δ32 mutation. This case, the seventh documented HIV cure globally, provides crucial insights into alternative mechanisms for achieving functional cure through alloimmunity rather than genetic resistance.

## Patient History

| Timeline | Event |
|:---------|:------|
| May 1990 | HIV diagnosis |
| 1990-2018 | Continuous antiretroviral treatment |
| January 2018 | Myeloid sarcoma diagnosis |
| July 2018 | Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant |
| Post-transplant | ART discontinuation |
| 32+ months post-ART | No viral rebound detected |

---

## Key Findings

### Viral Status Post-Transplant
| Parameter | Result |
|:----------|:-------|
| Viral particles | None detected |
| HIV reservoir | Undetectable |
| HIV antibodies | No immune response indicating viral presence |
| Duration of remission | 32+ months without ART |

### What Makes This Case Unique

| Previous Cure Cases | Geneva Patient |
|:--------------------|:---------------|
| CCR5Δ32/Δ32 donor cells | Wild-type CCR5 donor cells |
| Cells resistant to HIV entry | Cells susceptible to HIV infection |
| Resistance-based mechanism | **Alloimmunity-based mechanism** |

> "Previously, transplants without the CCR5Δ32 mutation had been performed in other HIV patients. However, if treatment was stopped, viral rebound occurred. The Geneva patient is the first to achieve prolonged remission."

## Proposed Mechanism: Alloimmunity

### How It Works
1. **Graft-versus-host effect**: Donor immune cells recognize and attack recipient cells
2. **Reservoir elimination**: HIV-infected cells destroyed during this immune confrontation
3. **Cell replacement**: Recipient's immune cells gradually replaced by donor cells
4. **Complete elimination**: Latently infected cells eliminated before replacement complete

> "A key factor is alloimmunity, which refers to the interaction between the immune system of the donor and that of the recipient."

### Supporting Evidence
Previous IrsiCaixa research linked alloimmunity to viral reservoir reduction during stem cell transplantation, validating this mechanism.

## Global Context: All HIV Cure Cases

| Patient | Year | Location | Mechanism |
|:--------|:-----|:---------|:----------|
| Berlin Patient (Timothy Brown) | 2008 | Berlin | CCR5Δ32 transplant |
| London Patient (Adam Castillejo) | 2019 | London | CCR5Δ32 transplant |
| Düsseldorf Patient | 2023 | Düsseldorf | CCR5Δ32 transplant |
| New York Patient | 2023 | New York | CCR5Δ32 transplant |
| City of Hope Patient | 2023 | California | CCR5Δ32 transplant |
| Second Berlin Patient | 2024 | Berlin | CCR5Δ32 transplant |
| **Geneva Patient** | **2024** | **Geneva** | **Alloimmunity (wild-type CCR5)** |

## Significance

### Implications for Cure Research
1. **Expands donor pool**: CCR5Δ32 mutation not required for cure
2. **New mechanism identified**: Alloimmunity alone can eliminate reservoir
3. **Research direction**: Focus on enhancing graft-vs-reservoir effects
4. **Mechanistic insights**: Understanding how immune attack clears latent cells

### Limitations
- Stem cell transplantation is high-risk, reserved for cancer patients
- Not a scalable solution for 39 million people living with HIV
- However, each case provides clues toward broadly applicable strategies

## Relevance to Project

The Geneva patient case informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Viral persistence**: Understanding which sequences survive immune attack
- **Reservoir elimination**: Complete clearance is achievable through immune mechanisms
- **Sequence evolution**: Pre/post-transplant viral sequence comparison opportunities
- **Immune pressure**: Selection patterns on viral sequences under alloimmune attack
