## Abstract

A clinical trial led by the UNC School of Medicine demonstrated that combining the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat with HIV-specific T-cell immunotherapy can coax HIV-infected cells out of latency and modestly reduce the latent reservoir. While results showed only a trend toward reservoir reduction, this "shock and kill" approach represents important progress toward understanding combination cure strategies.

## Key Concepts

- **Vorinostat**: HDAC inhibitor that reverses HIV latency ("shock" agent)
- **HIV-Specific T Cells**: Expanded autologous T cells targeting HIV ("kill" agent)
- **Latent Reservoir**: Resting CD4+ T cells harboring dormant HIV provirus
- **Shock and Kill**: Two-step strategy to reactivate and eliminate latent HIV

## Study Design

### Phase 1: Standard Dose
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Participants | 6 people with HIV on stable ART |
| Intervention | Multiple doses of vorinostat + expanded T cells |
| T-cell source | Autologous cells expanded at George Washington University |
| Primary outcome | Reservoir reduction |

### Phase 2: Intensified Dose
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Participants | 3 people with HIV |
| T-cell dose | **5x higher** than Phase 1 |
| Vorinostat | Standard dose |

## Mechanism of Action

### Vorinostat (Latency Reversal)
```
Latent HIV → Vorinostat inhibits HDAC →
Chromatin relaxation → HIV gene expression →
Viral protein production → Cell marked for killing
```

### HIV-Specific T Cells (Immune Clearance)
```
Expanded T cells → Recognize HIV antigens →
Kill infected cells → Reservoir reduction
```

## Results

### Phase 1 Results
| Outcome | Finding |
|:--------|:--------|
| Reservoir reduction | 1 of 6 participants showed decline |
| Statistical significance | Not achieved |
| Safety | Well-tolerated |

### Phase 2 Results (5x T-cell dose)
| Outcome | Finding |
|:--------|:--------|
| Reservoir reduction | All 3 participants showed slight decline |
| Statistical significance | Trend only, not significant |
| Magnitude | Modest reduction |

## Expert Commentary

> "We did show that this approach can reduce the reservoir, but the reductions were not nearly large enough, and statistically speaking were what we call a 'trend' but not highly statistically significant."
> — David Margolis, MD, Director, UNC HIV Cure Center

## Challenges Identified

1. **Incomplete latency reversal**: Vorinostat may not reactivate all latent cells
2. **Immune exhaustion**: T cells may not efficiently kill all reactivated cells
3. **Reservoir heterogeneity**: Different latent cell populations respond differently
4. **Statistical power**: Small study size limits ability to detect moderate effects

## Significance

Despite modest results, this trial:
1. **Demonstrated feasibility** of combining LRAs with immunotherapy
2. **Showed dose-response**: Higher T-cell doses yielded better trends
3. **Identified limitations** for optimizing future approaches
4. **Provided critical data** for designing next-generation trials

## Relevance to Project

This trial informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Latency markers**: Sequences associated with reactivation potential
- **Immune escape**: Variants that evade T-cell recognition
- **Selection pressure**: Sequences surviving shock-and-kill attack
- **Epitope prediction**: T-cell targets for immunotherapy design
