## Abstract

The PURPOSE 1 trial demonstrated unprecedented 100% efficacy of twice-yearly injectable lenacapavir for HIV prevention in cisgender women. Among 2,134 participants receiving lenacapavir, zero HIV infections occurred, compared to 55 infections in control arms. This landmark trial establishes lenacapavir as the most effective HIV prevention option ever tested, earning designation as Science Magazine's 2024 Breakthrough of the Year.

## Key Concepts

- **Lenacapavir**: First-in-class HIV-1 capsid inhibitor
- **PrEP**: Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention
- **Long-acting injectable**: Twice-yearly (every 26 weeks) subcutaneous injection
- **Superior efficacy**: 100% prevention vs daily oral options

|:----------|:--------|
| Design | Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled |
| Population | Adolescent girls and young women (16-25 years) |
| Locations | South Africa, Uganda |
| Randomization | 2:2:1 ratio |
| Duration | Enrollment through blinded phase |

### Treatment Arms
| Arm | Intervention | N |
|:----|:-------------|:--|

## Results

### Primary Efficacy Outcome
| Arm | HIV Infections | Incidence |
|:----|:---------------|:----------|
| **Lenacapavir** | **0** | **0.00%** |
| F/TAF (daily oral) | 39 | 1.83% |
| F/TDF (daily oral) | 16 | 1.50% |

### Key Statistics
- **100% efficacy** vs background incidence
- **Zero infections** among 2,134 lenacapavir recipients
- **100% superiority** over daily oral F/TAF
- **Sustained protection** throughout 26-week dosing intervals

## Safety Profile

| Finding | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Tolerability | Well tolerated |
| Injection site reactions | Common but manageable |
| Serious adverse events | No significant concerns |
| Discontinuations | Low rate |

## Significance

PURPOSE 1 represents a paradigm shift in HIV prevention:
1. **First 100% efficacy** demonstrated for any HIV prevention method
2. **Twice-yearly dosing** eliminates daily adherence challenges
3. **Female-controlled option** empowers women in high-burden settings
4. **Science Breakthrough 2024** recognized for transformative impact

## Relevance to Project

The PURPOSE 1 trial informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Capsid sequences**: Target for lenacapavir binding
- **Resistance mutations**: Rare but critical to monitor (Q67H, K70R)
- **Prevention efficacy**: Near-elimination of breakthrough infections
- **Sequence conservation**: Capsid as highly conserved drug target
