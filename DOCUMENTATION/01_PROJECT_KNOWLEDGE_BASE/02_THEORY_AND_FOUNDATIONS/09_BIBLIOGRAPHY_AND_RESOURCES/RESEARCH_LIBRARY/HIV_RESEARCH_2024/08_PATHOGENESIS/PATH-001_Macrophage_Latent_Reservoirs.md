## Abstract

This study provides definitive evidence that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) constitute a clinically relevant HIV reservoir, using a newly developed quantitative viral outgrowth assay (MDM-QVOA) to assess latent HIV frequency in monocytes from virally suppressed people with HIV (vsPWH).

## Key Concepts

- **Myeloid Reservoir**: HIV persisting in macrophages and monocytes
- **MDM-QVOA**: Monocyte-derived macrophage quantitative viral outgrowth assay
- **IPDA**: Intact proviral DNA assay adapted for myeloid cells
- **vsPWH**: Virally suppressed people with HIV

## Methodology

### Novel Assay Development
| Assay | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| MDM-QVOA | Quantify reactivatable latent HIV in monocytes |
| Myeloid-adapted IPDA | Detect intact HIV genomes in monocytes |

---

## Key Findings

### Latent HIV in Monocytes
| Cohort | Result |
|:-------|:-------|
| Longitudinal (n=10) | 50% showed latent HIV in monocytes |
| Cross-sectional (n=30) | 40% had intact proviral genomes |

### Correlation
> "Higher total HIV DNA correlated with reactivatable latent reservoirs"

---

## Significance

### Clinical Relevance
> "These findings provide further evidence that myeloid cells meet the definition of a clinically relevant HIV reservoir and emphasize that myeloid reservoirs should be included in efforts towards an HIV cure."

### Distribution of Reservoirs
| Tissue | Macrophage Presence |
|:-------|:--------------------|
| CNS | Yes |
| Lymph nodes | Yes |
| Spleen | Yes |
| Lungs | Yes |
| Digestive tract | Yes |
| Genitourinary tract | Yes |

## Implications for Cure Research

1. **Cure Strategies**: Must target both T cell and myeloid reservoirs
2. **Measurement**: New assays needed for myeloid reservoir quantification
3. **Drug Development**: Agents must reach tissue-resident macrophages
4. **Lifespan**: Macrophages can persist for years (brain ~4 years)

## Macrophage Characteristics

| Feature | Implication |
|:--------|:------------|
| Long-lived | Persistent reservoir |
| Tissue-resident | Hard to reach with drugs |
| Self-renewing | Can maintain reservoir over time |
| Variable half-life | Weeks to years depending on tissue |

## Relevance to Project

Macrophage reservoirs relate to:
- Distinct HIV populations in different cell types
- Cell-type specific codon usage adaptations
- Sequence evolution in tissue compartments
- Implications for resistance development
