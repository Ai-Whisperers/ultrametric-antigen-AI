## Abstract

Two Phase 1 clinical trials (IAVI G002 and G003) provide definitive proof-of-concept that a targeted germline-targeting vaccine strategy can successfully activate VRC01-class B cell responses relevant to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) development. The G002 trial demonstrated that heterologous boosting advances bnAb precursor maturation, while G003 confirmed comparable responses in African populations where HIV burden is highest.

## Key Concepts

- **Germline Targeting (GT)**: Vaccine designed to activate rare naive B cells with bnAb potential
- **VRC01-class antibodies**: bnAbs targeting the CD4 binding site on HIV envelope
- **Heterologous boosting**: Using different but related immunogens in sequential doses
- **Somatic hypermutation (SHM)**: B cell mutation process required for bnAb development

## Trial Designs

### IAVI G002 (North America)
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Enrollment | 60 participants |
| Location | North America |
| Design | Prime alone vs prime-boost |
| Vaccine delivery | mRNA |

### IAVI G003 (Africa)
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Enrollment | 18 participants |
| Locations | South Africa, Rwanda |
| Design | Two priming doses (no boost) |
| Purpose | Validate responses in high-burden populations |

## Results

### G002 Trial Results
| Outcome | Finding |
|:--------|:--------|
| VRC01-class response rate | **100%** (17/17 boosted participants) |
| "Elite" responders | **>80%** showed multiple beneficial mutations |
| Optimal regimen | **One prime + one boost** (more effective than two primes + boost) |
| SHM levels | Increased after boost |
| Affinity | Improved post-boost |

### G003 Trial Results
| Outcome | Finding |
|:--------|:--------|
| VRC01-class response rate | **94%** of participants |
| SHM levels | Comparable to G002 |
| Antibody diversity | High |
| Regional comparison | Similar to North American responses |

> "By and large, the immune responses were quite similar in Africa and North America. That's encouraging for a vaccine intended for global use." — William Schief, Scripps Research

## Safety Profile

| Trial | Safety Finding |
|:------|:---------------|
| G002 | 18% experienced skin reactions (urticaria) |
| G003 | No urticaria; 11% mild itching |
| Management | Antihistamines effective |
| Severity | Mostly mild to moderate |

## Significance

### Scientific Breakthroughs
1. **Clinical proof-of-concept** for germline-targeting strategy
2. **Heterologous boosting** advances bnAb maturation
3. **mRNA platform** as effective as or more than protein delivery
4. **African validation** confirms global applicability

### Vaccine Development Implications
> "Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM; heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development."

## Next Steps

| Phase | Plans |
|:------|:------|
| Follow-up Africa trial | Prime-boost at lower dose in South Africa |
| Consortium launch | 2025, led by IAVI with Gates Foundation funding |
| Additional antigens | GT vaccines for other bnAb classes |
| Phase 2 trials | Building on elite responses |

## Relevance to Project

The IAVI G002/G003 trials inform the Ternary VAE project:
- **Envelope sequences**: Understanding immunogen design requirements
- **Mutation analysis**: Predicting sequences that elicit bnAb responses
- **Conservation patterns**: Identifying invariant epitopes for targeting
- **Global sequences**: Ensuring vaccine coverage across HIV subtypes
