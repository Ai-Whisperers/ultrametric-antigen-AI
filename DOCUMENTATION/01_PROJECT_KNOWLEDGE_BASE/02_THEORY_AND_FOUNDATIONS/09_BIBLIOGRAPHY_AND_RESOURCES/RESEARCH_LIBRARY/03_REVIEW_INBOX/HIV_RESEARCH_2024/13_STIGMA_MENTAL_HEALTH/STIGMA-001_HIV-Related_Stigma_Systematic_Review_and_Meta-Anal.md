## Abstract

This 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis examines the global prevalence of HIV-related stigma and its associations with depression among people living with HIV (PLWH). The findings demonstrate robust correlations between stigma and adverse mental health outcomes, with significant implications for treatment adherence, healthcare utilization, and quality of life.

## Key Concepts

- **Internalized Stigma**: Self-acceptance of negative beliefs about one's HIV status
- **Anticipated Stigma**: Expectation of future prejudice and discrimination
- **Enacted Stigma**: Direct experiences of discrimination
- **Disclosure Stigma**: Fear of negative consequences from revealing status

---

## Types of HIV Stigma

### Three Dimensions
| Type | Definition | Manifestation |
|:-----|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Internalized** | Self-directed negative beliefs | Self-blame, shame, guilt |
| **Anticipated** | Expected future prejudice | Fear of disclosure |
| **Enacted** | Experienced discrimination | Healthcare refusal, social rejection |

### Healthcare Setting Stigma
| Manifestation | Impact |
|:--------------|:-------|
| Treatment refusal | Delayed care |
| Confidentiality breaches | Trust erosion |
| Differential treatment | Care avoidance |
| Provider attitudes | Health-seeking behavior |

---

## Mental Health Associations

### Depression Link
> "Research has found a robust correlation between high levels of HIV-related stigma and high levels of depression."

| Outcome | Association |
|:--------|:------------|
| Depressive symptoms | Strongly positive |
| Psychological distress | Significantly elevated |
| Self-esteem | Decreased |
| Well-being | Reduced |

### Meta-Analytic Findings
| Variable | Effect |
|:---------|:-------|
| Internalized stigma → Depression | Strong positive correlation |
| Stigma → Self-esteem | Negative correlation |
| Stigma → Distress | Positive correlation |
| Stigma → Quality of life | Negative correlation |

## Clinical and Health Outcomes

### Treatment Adherence
| Outcome | Stigma Effect |
|:--------|:--------------|
| ART adherence | **Major barrier** |
| Care retention | Reduced |
| Appointment attendance | Decreased |
| Medication persistence | Impaired |

> "HIV-related stigma is a major barrier to retention in HIV care, adherence to HIV care visits, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among PLWH."

### Viral Outcomes
| Measure | Association |
|:--------|:------------|
| Viral suppression | Suboptimal with high stigma |
| CD4 recovery | Delayed |
| Clinical outcomes | Poorer |

---

## Healthcare Avoidance

### Mechanisms
```
Internalized stigma → Fear of discrimination →
Healthcare avoidance → Delayed diagnosis/treatment →
Worse health outcomes
```

### Service Utilization
| Service | Stigma Effect |
|:--------|:--------------|
| Mental health services | Underutilized |
| HIV testing | Delayed/avoided |
| Prevention services | Lower uptake |
| Regular follow-up | Missed appointments |

> "PLWH who have been self-stigmatizing might begin to avoid utilizing healthcare services because of the fear that they will be subject to stigma and discrimination from healthcare workers."

---

## Syndemic Burden (2024)

### Intersecting Factors
| Factor | Interaction |
|:-------|:------------|
| Age | Differential stigma effects |
| Sexual minority status | Compounded stigma |
| Substance use | Multiple stigmas |
| Mental illness | Dual stigma burden |

> "Internalized HIV stigma has been associated with several poor mental and physical health outcomes among PLWH; syndemic burden affects these relationships."

---

## Global Variations

### Regional Differences
| Region | Stigma Level | Key Factors |
|:-------|:-------------|:------------|
| Sub-Saharan Africa | Variable | Community norms, disclosure |
| North America | Moderate | MSM-specific, racial disparities |
| Asia Pacific | High | Cultural factors, legal status |
| Europe | Lower | Healthcare system factors |

---

## Intervention Approaches

### Contact Hypothesis
> "Facilitating social interaction between PLWH and others may help to reduce prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination through increased knowledge, reduced anxiety, and increased empathy."

### Effective Strategies
| Intervention | Target |
|:-------------|:-------|
| Education | Knowledge gaps |
| Contact programs | Prejudice reduction |
| Disclosure support | Anticipated stigma |
| Healthcare training | Provider attitudes |

---

## Disclosure Considerations

### Impact on Prevention
| Factor | Public Health Relevance |
|:-------|:-----------------------|
| Disclosure decisions | Partner notification |
| Status sharing | Prevention messaging |
| Community visibility | Stigma reduction |

> "Stigma may affect HIV disclosure decisions, which has important individual and public health implications."

---

## Relevance to Project

While stigma research is primarily psychosocial, it informs the Ternary VAE project through:
- **Healthcare access**: Affects sequence data availability from underrepresented populations
- **Surveillance gaps**: Stigma reduces testing, affecting epidemiological data
- **Treatment adherence**: Impacts resistance development patterns
- **Public health context**: Broader framework for computational HIV research
