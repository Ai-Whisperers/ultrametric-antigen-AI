## Abstract

The WHO brief report summarizes recent information on HIV drug resistance in the era of integrase-strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) for HIV prevention and treatment. It documents high levels of viral suppression with dolutegravir-containing ART while noting emerging resistance concerns.

---

## Key Concepts

- **INSTI Resistance**: Emerging resistance to integrase inhibitors
- **Dolutegravir (DTG)**: Current first-line recommendation
- **Viral Suppression**: >90% suppression rates achieved
- **Treatment Transition**: Challenges with switching regimens

---

## Main Findings

### Viral Suppression Rates
- WHO documents high levels (>90%) of HIV viral load suppression in populations receiving DTG-containing ART

### DTG Resistance Levels
| Survey Population | Resistance Rate |
|:------------------|:----------------|
| Range across surveys | 3.9% - 8.6% |
| Highly treatment-experienced (high VL at switch) | Up to 19.6% |

### Key Concern
> "Recent observational data reveal that HIVDR to DTG is emerging at levels exceeding those observed in clinical trials."

## Resistance Mutation Patterns

### By Drug Class
| Class | Key Mutations | Prevalence 2024 |
|:------|:--------------|:----------------|
| NRTIs | M184V, K65R | 23.8% (LLV patients) |
| NNRTIs | K103N, V179, Y181 | 35.6% (LLV patients) |
| PIs | - | 5.8% |
| INSTIs | Emerging | 3.9% |

### Common Mutations in Low-Level Viremia (LLV)
- V184 (18.27%)
- V179 (11.54%)
- K103 (9.62%)
- Y181 (9.62%)
- M41 (7.69%)
- K65R (7.69%)

## Long-Acting Agent Resistance

### Cabotegravir (CAB-LA) for PrEP
- INSTI resistance observed in some cases with recent CAB-LA exposure
- Delayed HIV detection increases risk of resistance selection

### Lenacapavir Resistance
- Major resistance mutations Q67H + K70R detected
- High-level resistance to LEN identified September 2024
- Occurred ~1 month after third LEN injection

---

## Implications

1. **Surveillance**: Enhanced monitoring for INSTI resistance needed
2. **Testing**: Viral load testing before regimen switches critical
3. **Prevention**: PrEP breakthrough cases require genotyping
4. **Treatment**: Second-line options must be protected

---

## Relevance to Project

Drug resistance mutations are critical for:
- Training resistance prediction models
- Understanding selection pressures on viral sequences
- Validating codon usage analyses against functional constraints
