## Abstract

The ROSETTA Registry provides comprehensive European data on resistance patterns emerging during virological failure on second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), including dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BIC), and cabotegravir (CAB). Results reveal that major integrase resistance mutations are detected in 26% of virological failures, with higher rates in treatment-experienced individuals and significant cross-resistance implications.

## Key Concepts

- **Second-Generation INSTIs**: DTG, BIC, CAB (higher barrier to resistance)
- **ROSETTA Registry**: European database of INSTI resistance cases
- **Major Integrase Mutations**: Defined by IAS-USA resistance guidelines
- **Cross-Resistance**: Mutations affecting multiple INSTI drugs

## Registry Overview

### Study Population
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Setting | European multi-center registry |
| Virological failures | 125 individuals on 2nd-gen INSTIs |
| Time period | Through 2024 |
| Resistance testing | Genotypic sequencing |

---

## Key Findings

### Resistance Detection Rates
| Finding | Percentage |
|:--------|:-----------|
| Major integrase resistance | **26% (33/125)** |
| Treatment-experienced (with prior INSTI) | Higher rates |
| Treatment-naive | Lower rates |

> "Major integrase resistance mutations associated with integrase inhibitor resistance in the IAS-USA database were detected in samples from 33 of the 125 individuals (26%) experiencing virological failure on second-generation INSTIs."

### Treatment Experience Effect
| Population | Resistance Pattern |
|:-----------|:-------------------|
| Prior INSTI exposure | More frequent mutations |
| INSTI-naive | Distinct pathways |
| Multi-regimen history | Highest risk |

---

## Key Resistance Mutations

### Primary INSTI Resistance Positions
| Position | Mutations | Significance |
|:---------|:----------|:-------------|
| 118 | G118R | First-gen-naive pathway |
| 140 | G140S/A/R | Cross-resistance |
| 148 | Q148H/R/K | High-level resistance |
| 155 | N155H | Common primary mutation |
| 263 | R263K | DTG-specific pathway |

### Mutation Combinations
| Combination | Resistance Level |
|:------------|:-----------------|
| T97A/G140S/G148H | **>1000-fold** |
| Single mutations | <10-fold |
| Two mutations | Moderate |

> "Combinations of two to four of these mutations confer >10-fold resistance, with the highest level of resistance observed with T97A/G140S/G148H."

## Drug-Specific Pathways

### Dolutegravir (DTG)
| Pathway | Signature Mutations |
|:--------|:-------------------|
| Pathway 1 | R263K |
| Pathway 2 | G118R |
| Pathway 3 | N155H |
| Pathway 4 | Q148H/R/K |

### Cabotegravir (CAB)
| Mutation | Frequency | Cross-Resistance |
|:---------|:----------|:-----------------|
| Q148R | Most common | High-level CAB, low DTG |
| N155H | Common | Moderate all INSTIs |
| E138K | Selected | Accessory |

### Bictegravir (BIC)
| Pattern | Impact |
|:--------|:-------|
| Q148-pathway | Reduced susceptibility |
| R263K | Low-level |
| Novel patterns | Under investigation |

---

## Cross-Resistance Implications

### Clinical Concern
| Scenario | Future Options |
|:---------|:---------------|
| CAB PrEP failure | Reduced DTG/BIC efficacy |
| DTG failure | Variable CAB impact |
| Multi-mutation accumulation | Limited INSTI class options |

> "The accumulation of multiple INSTI mutations is required for high-level cabotegravir resistance, and the same mutation combinations may cause cross-resistance to dolutegravir."

### Treatment Sequencing Concerns
| First INSTI | Resistance at Failure | Impact on Next INSTI |
|:------------|:---------------------|:--------------------|
| CAB (PrEP) | Q148R + accessory | Reduced DTG/BIC |
| DTG | Variable | CAB may retain activity |
| RAL/EVG | Classic pathways | 2nd-gen may work |

---

## Injectable CAB-Specific Data

### Virological Failure Rates
| Study | VF Rate | INSTI Resistance |
|:------|:--------|:-----------------|
| Meta-analysis | Low at 48 weeks | **41-71% at failure** |
| Real-world | Similar | Cross-resistance common |

> "Although 48-week virological failure rates were low, emergent integrase resistance among those failing injectable cabotegravir was common (41%–71%)."

### Dual-Class Resistance
| Outcome | Percentage |
|:--------|:-----------|
| RPV + CAB resistance | 56% of failures tested |
| Reduced DTG/BIC susceptibility | 44% estimated |

---

## Prevention Implications

### CAB-LA PrEP Breakthrough
| Finding | Significance |
|:--------|:-------------|
| 10 resistance cases | From PrEP trials + real-world |
| All had DTG cross-resistance | Limits first-line treatment |
| Mechanism | Incomplete adherence, prior infection |

> "To date, 10 cases of integrase inhibitor drug resistance have been reported among people who received long-acting cabotegravir PrEP, and all 10 cases had mutations that confer cross-resistance to dolutegravir."

## Relevance to Project

INSTI resistance patterns directly inform the Ternary VAE project:
- **Integrase sequence modeling**: Resistance mutation prediction
- **Fitness landscapes**: Balancing resistance and replication capacity
- **Codon analysis**: Mutational pathways to resistance
- **Clinical prediction**: Sequence-based resistance forecasting
