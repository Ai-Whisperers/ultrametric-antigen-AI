## Abstract

Characterization of drug resistance mutations in ART-experienced patients with low-level viremia (50-999 copies/mL).

---

## Key Concepts

- Primary research focus from 2023-2025 HIV literature
- Relevant to understanding HIV biology, treatment, or prevention
- Contributes to the broader HIV research landscape

---

## Relevance to Project

This paper contributes to the Ternary VAE bioinformatics project by providing context on:
- HIV sequence evolution and variability
- Biological constraints on viral fitness
- Therapeutic targets and resistance mechanisms
