## Abstract

Lenacapavir resistance mutations Q67H and K70R represent critical capsid sequence changes conferring high-level resistance to this first-in-class capsid inhibitor. First detected in clinical trials during functional monotherapy, a September 2024 case documented emergence of both mutations after the third injection, highlighting the importance of complete suppression and avoiding inadvertent monotherapy.

## Key Concepts

- **Lenacapavir (GS-6207)**: First-in-class capsid inhibitor, long-acting (6-month dosing)
- **Capsid Resistance**: Mutations in CA protein affecting drug binding
- **Q67H**: Major resistance mutation at position 67 (Gln→His)
- **K70R**: Major resistance mutation at position 70 (Lys→Arg)
- **Functional Monotherapy**: Drug exposure without other active antivirals

## Clinical Trial Resistance Data

### CAPELLA Trial Results
| Mutation Pattern | Patients | Fold-Change in Susceptibility |
|:-----------------|:---------|:------------------------------|
| M66I | 6 | **234-fold increase** |
| K70H | 1 | **265-fold increase** |
| Q67H + K70R | 1 | **15-fold increase** |
| M66I + N74D | 1 | High-level |

> "Postbaseline resistance mutations to lenacapavir occurred in 8 participants who were receiving unintended functional lenacapavir monotherapy at the time of resistance selection."

## 2024 Case Report: Los Angeles

### Clinical Timeline
| Date | Event |
|:-----|:------|
| March 2023 | First lenacapavir injection |
| Post-1st dose | Viral suppression achieved |
| Post-2nd dose | High viral loads observed |
| March-April 2024 | Lenacapavir monotherapy period |
| September 2024 | Q67H + K70R mutations detected |

### Key Finding
> "Two major resistance mutations, Q67H and K70R, were detected in the capsid region following the third lenacapavir injection, conferring high-level resistance."

## Structural Mechanism

### Q67H Mutation Effect
```
Wild-type Gln67 → His67 mutation →
Conformational switch →
His67 projects into binding pocket →
Steric hindrance with lenacapavir →
Reduced drug binding
```

### Binding Pocket Alteration
| Mutation | Structural Effect |
|:---------|:------------------|
| Q67H | Closed conformation blocks drug |
| K70R | Electrostatic change at interface |
| Q67H/K70R | Synergistic resistance |

> "The Q67H change induces a conformational switch which adversely affects the inhibitor binding. In the unliganded protein, the His67 side chain adopts the closed conformation by projecting into the inhibitor binding pocket."

## Natural Prevalence of Resistance Mutations

### Global Surveillance (21,646 sequences)
| Mutation | Treatment-Naive Prevalence | Notable Subtype |
|:---------|:---------------------------|:----------------|
| Q67H | 22 sequences (0.10%) | CRF01_AE (0.56%) |
| K70R | 8 sequences (0.04%) | Variable |
| M66I | Rare | - |
| N74D | Present | Also affects CPSF6 |

> "The most prevalent mutation was Q67H, and this mutation was more common in CRF01_AE."

### Major Lenacapavir Resistance Mutations
| Position | Mutations | Resistance Level |
|:---------|:----------|:-----------------|
| 66 | M66I | High |
| 67 | Q67H | Moderate-High |
| 70 | K70R, K70H | High |
| 74 | N74D | Moderate (with others) |

## Prevention of Resistance

### Key Lessons
| Factor | Recommendation |
|:-------|:---------------|
| Functional monotherapy | **Avoid at all costs** |
| Viral suppression | Confirm before each injection |
| Companion drugs | Ensure active backbone |
| Adherence | Critical for long-acting |

### Risk Factors
| Risk | Mechanism |
|:-----|:----------|
| Inadequate backbone | Allows viral replication |
| Delayed dosing | Subtherapeutic levels |
| Prior resistance | Cross-resistance potential |

## Relevance to Project

Lenacapavir resistance informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Capsid sequence constraints**: Residues critical for drug binding
- **Resistance prediction**: Structural basis for escape mutations
- **Fitness costs**: Impact of resistance on viral replication
- **Codon evolution**: Mutational pathways at key positions
