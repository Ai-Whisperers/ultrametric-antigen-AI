## Abstract

This landmark 2024 study documents the first confirmed transmission of an X4-tropic HIV-1 transmitted/founder (T/F) virus through the mucosal route in an individual with wild-type CCR5 genotype. The case challenges the long-held paradigm that CCR5-tropic (R5) viruses exclusively establish new infections, with significant implications for CCR5-targeted prevention strategies and understanding of HIV pathogenesis.

## Key Concepts

- **Coreceptor Tropism**: CCR5 (R5) vs CXCR4 (X4) usage for cell entry
- **Transmitted/Founder (T/F) Virus**: Virus establishing new infection
- **CCR5Δ32**: Deletion conferring HIV resistance
- **Tropism Switch**: Evolution from R5 to X4 during infection
- **RV217 Cohort**: Acute HIV infection study in Thailand/East Africa

## Background: Coreceptor Biology

### HIV Entry Requirements
```
HIV gp120 → CD4 binding → Conformational change →
Coreceptor binding (CCR5 or CXCR4) → gp41 fusion → Entry
```

### Tropism Distribution
| Tropism | Stage | Frequency |
|:--------|:------|:----------|
| R5 (CCR5) | Transmission | >99% of T/F viruses |
| X4 (CXCR4) | Late infection | ~50% of subtype B/D |
| Dual/Mixed | Variable | Common in progression |

## Index Case (Participant 40700)

### Patient Characteristics
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Cohort | RV217 acute infection study |
| CCR5 genotype | Wild-type (normal) |
| Infection stage | Detected at acute phase |
| T/F virus tropism | **Exclusively X4-tropic** |
| CCR5 usage | None detected |

### Viral Characteristics
| Feature | Finding |
|:--------|:--------|
| Single T/F genome | Confirmed |
| CXCR4 tropism | Complete (no R5 capability) |
| V3 loop sequence | Characteristic X4 features |
| Mucosal transmission | Confirmed route |

---

## Clinical Outcomes

### Disease Progression
| Parameter | Participant 40700 | R5 T/F Controls |
|:----------|:------------------|:----------------|
| CD4 decline rate | **Significantly faster** | Slower |
| Disease progression | Accelerated | Standard |
| Viral dynamics | More aggressive | Typical |

> "Participant 40700 was infected by an X4 tropic HIV-1 without CCR5 using ability, and experienced significantly faster CD4 depletion compared to R5 virus infected individuals in the same cohort."

## Why X4 Transmission is Rare

### Target Cell Availability
| Receptor | T Cell Expression |
|:---------|:------------------|
| CCR5 | 15-30% of CD4+ T cells |
| CXCR4 | ~100% of CD4+ T cells |

### Mucosal Barrier Factors
| Factor | R5 Advantage |
|:-------|:-------------|
| Dendritic cells | Express CCR5, capture R5 virus |
| Mucosal memory T cells | CCR5-high expression |
| Initial target cells | CCR5+ predominate |
| X4 virus fragility | May be less stable mucosally |

---

## Implications for CCR5-Based Strategies

### Affected Approaches
| Strategy | Concern |
|:---------|:--------|
| CCR5Δ32 gene editing | May not prevent all infections |
| Maraviroc prophylaxis | X4 virus could bypass |
| CCR5-blocking bnAbs | Limited to R5 prevention |

### Key Message
> "X4-tropic HIV-1 is transmissible through mucosal route in people with wild-type CCR5 genotype. The CD4 subset tropism of HIV-1 may be an important determinant for HIV-1 transmissibility and virulence."

## V3 Loop Determinants

### Genetic Features of X4 Tropism
| Position | X4 Characteristic |
|:---------|:------------------|
| Position 11 | Positive charge (K, R) |
| Position 24 | Positive charge (K, R) |
| Position 25 | Positive charge (K, R) |
| Overall V3 | Net positive charge ≥+5 |

### Prediction Tools
| Algorithm | Accuracy |
|:----------|:---------|
| Geno2pheno | 85-90% |
| PSSM | 80-85% |
| Deep learning models | 90-95% |

## Related 2024 Research: SLC35A2

### Fred Hutchinson Discovery
| Finding | Significance |
|:--------|:-------------|
| SLC35A2 expression | Promotes R5 infection, hinders X4 |
| Mechanism | T cell glycosylation patterns |
| Implication | Host factors influence tropism susceptibility |

> "Researchers identified a host protein called SLC35A2 that impacts HIV-1 infection based on what coreceptor the given viral strain uses."

## Relevance to Project

X4 transmission findings inform the Ternary VAE project:
- **V3 sequence modeling**: Tropism determinant prediction
- **Fitness landscapes**: X4 vs R5 transmission fitness
- **Codon evolution**: V3 codon patterns and tropism
- **Pathogenesis prediction**: Tropism-clinical outcome relationships
