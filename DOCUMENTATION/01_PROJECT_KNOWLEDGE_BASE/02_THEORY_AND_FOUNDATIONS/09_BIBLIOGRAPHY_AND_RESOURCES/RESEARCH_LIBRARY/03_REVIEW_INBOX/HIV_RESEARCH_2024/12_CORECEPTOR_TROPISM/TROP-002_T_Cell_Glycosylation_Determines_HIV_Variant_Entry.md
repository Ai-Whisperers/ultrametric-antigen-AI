## Abstract

This landmark 2024 study from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center used CRISPR knockout screens in primary CD4+ T cells to discover that SLC35A2—a UDP-galactose transporter involved in glycosylation—selectively restricts X4-tropic HIV while promoting R5-tropic infection. This provides the first mechanistic explanation for why R5 viruses dominate during transmission despite X4 viruses having broader target cell access.

## Key Concepts

- **SLC35A2**: UDP-galactose transporter essential for T cell glycosylation
- **Glycan Truncation**: Removal of galactose from cell surface sugars
- **Transmission Bottleneck**: Selection favoring R5 viruses during infection
- **Tropism-Selective Restriction**: Host factors preferentially blocking one tropism

## The Discovery

### CRISPR Screening Approach
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| System | Genome-wide CRISPR knockout |
| Target cells | Primary CD4+ T cells |
| Screen design | Compare X4 vs R5 infection |
| Key finding | SLC35A2 as X4-specific restriction factor |

### Research Team
| Researchers | Institution |

| Itell HL, Guenthoer J, Humes D | Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center |
| Baumgarten NE, Overbaugh J | Division of Human Biology |

## Mechanism of Action

### SLC35A2 Function
```
UDP-galactose transport → Cell surface glycosylation →
Galactose attached to glycans → Altered receptor environment →
Differential HIV tropism susceptibility
```

### Effect on Tropism
| Condition | R5 Infection | X4 Infection |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Normal SLC35A2 | Normal | Restricted |
| SLC35A2 knockout | **Decreased** | **Increased** |
| Glycan truncation | Impaired | Enhanced |

> "SLC35A2 inactivation in CD4+ T cells, which resulted in truncation of glycans due to the absence of galactose, not only increased X4 infection levels, but also consistently decreased infection levels of R5 HIV strains."

## Validation Studies

### Glycan Analysis
| Lectin | Target | SLC35A2 KO Effect |
|:-------|:-------|:------------------|
| GSL-II | Complex glycans | Decreased binding |
| VVL | Tn antigen | Increased binding |

### Infection Assays
| Experiment | Finding |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Single-cycle infection | Effect is host cell dependent |
| Primary T cells | Confirmed tropism-selective restriction |
| Cell lines | Recapitulated primary cell results |

## Tissue Distribution

### SLC35A2 Expression Patterns
| Tissue Site | Expression Level | Relevance |
|:------------|:-----------------|:----------|
| Genital tract | **High** | Site of most HIV transmission |
| Blood T cells | Moderate | Systemic infection |
| Gut-associated | Variable | Reservoir site |

> "SLC35A2 is expressed in CD4+ T cells at different tissue sites, with high levels in the genital tract – the site of most HIV infections."

## Implications for Transmission

### Why R5 Viruses Dominate
| Factor | Contribution |
|:-------|:-------------|
| SLC35A2 restriction | Blocks X4 at mucosal entry |
| Glycan barrier | Favors R5 virus binding |
| Target cell glycosylation | Selects transmitted variants |

### Transmission Bottleneck Explained
> "HIV-1 infection involves a selection bottleneck that leads to transmission of one or a few HIV variants, which nearly always use CCR5 as the coreceptor."

## Future Research Directions

### Open Questions
1. **Mechanism**: How exactly do host sugars differentially impact R5 and X4?
2. **In vivo relevance**: Do R5 viruses have the advantage in first-infected cells?
3. **Therapeutic potential**: Can glycosylation be targeted for prevention?

### Potential Applications
| Application | Approach |
|:------------|:---------|
| Biomarkers | Glycosylation state as tropism predictor |
| Prevention | Targeting glycosylation pathways |
| Tropism prediction | Integrating host factors |

## Relevance to Project

SLC35A2-tropism findings inform the Ternary VAE project:
- **V3 sequence-tropism**: Host factors modulate sequence-phenotype relationships
- **Fitness landscapes**: Glycosylation as environmental constraint
- **Transmission prediction**: Sequence features favored at mucosal sites
- **Codon evolution**: Selection pressures beyond direct host immunity
