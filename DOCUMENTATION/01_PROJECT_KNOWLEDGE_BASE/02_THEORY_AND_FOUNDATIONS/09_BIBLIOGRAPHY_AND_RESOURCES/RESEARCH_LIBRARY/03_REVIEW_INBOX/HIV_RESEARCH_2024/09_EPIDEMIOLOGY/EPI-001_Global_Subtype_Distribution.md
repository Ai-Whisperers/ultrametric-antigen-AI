## Abstract

This systematic review provides the most comprehensive analysis of global HIV-1 genetic diversity from 2010-2021, revealing the distribution of subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and unique recombinant forms (URFs) across all regions.

---

## Key Concepts

- **HIV-1 Subtypes**: A-D, F-H, J-L (10 distinct subtypes)
- **CRFs**: Circulating recombinant forms (>150 described)
- **URFs**: Unique recombinant forms
- **Genetic Diversity**: Variation across global populations

## Global Distribution (2016-2021)

| Subtype/Form | Global Percentage |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Subtype C | 50.4% |
| CRFs | 15.1% |
| Subtype A | 12.4% |
| Subtype B | 11.3% |
| Subtype G | 2.9% |
| Subtype D | 2.6% |
| URFs | 2.0% |
| Subtype F | 0.9% |

---

## Regional Variations

| Region | Dominant Form |
|:-------|:--------------|
| Southern Africa, Ethiopia, India | Subtype C |
| Caribbean, Latin America, North America, Western Europe | Subtype B |
| Eastern Europe, Central Asia | Subtype A |
| Southeast Asia | CRF01_AE |
| Central, West, East Africa | High diversity (multiple) |

---

## Temporal Trends (2010-15 vs 2016-21)

| Change | Direction |
|:-------|:----------|
| Subtype A | +0.9% (increase) |
| Subtype C | +3.4% (increase) |
| Subtype D | Decrease |
| Subtype G | Decrease |
| CRFs | Decrease |
| URFs | Decrease |

---

## CRF Status

> "Currently, 140 HIV-1 CRFs have been described; however, their prevalence and clinical importance are less well characterized."

### New CRF Discovery (2024)
- CRF159_01103 identified in Hebei Province, China
- Derived from CRF103_01B and CRF01_AE
- Found in three MSM with no epidemiological linkage

---

## Implications

1. **Vaccine Development**: Must account for global diversity
2. **Diagnostics**: Assays must detect all subtypes
3. **Treatment**: Potential subtype-specific drug responses
4. **Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring essential

---

## Relevance to Project

HIV-1 genetic diversity is fundamental to:
- Training sequence models on diverse subtypes
- Understanding codon usage variations across subtypes
- Developing broadly applicable analytical tools
- Validating predictions across viral populations
