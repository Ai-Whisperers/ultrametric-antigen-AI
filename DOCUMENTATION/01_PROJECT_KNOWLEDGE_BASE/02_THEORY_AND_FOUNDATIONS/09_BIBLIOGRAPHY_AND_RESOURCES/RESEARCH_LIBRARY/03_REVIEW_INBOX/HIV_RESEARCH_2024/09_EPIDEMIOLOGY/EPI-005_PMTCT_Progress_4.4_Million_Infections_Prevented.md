## Abstract

Between 2000 and 2024, Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) programs have prevented approximately 4.4 million child HIV infections worldwide. This remarkable public health achievement demonstrates the power of targeted intervention, with treatment coverage reaching 84% in 2024 and mother-to-child transmission rates dropping from 23% to 10% over 14 years.

## Key Concepts

- **PMTCT**: Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission
- **EMTCT**: Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission
- **Super-Fast-Track Framework**: UNAIDS accelerated response
- **Triple Elimination**: HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B elimination goals

## Global Impact Summary

### Infections Prevented
| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| Children protected | **4.4 million** |
| Time period | 2000-2024 |
| Primary contributors | Eastern & Southern Africa (79%) |
| Secondary contributors | Western & Central Africa (14%) |

> "About 4.4 million children born from HIV-infected mothers were prevented from maternal transmission of HIV as a result of PMTCT implementation."

## Current Status (2024)

### New Child Infections
| Year | Infections | Trend |
|:-----|:-----------|:------|
| 2010 | 310,000 | Baseline |
| 2024 | **120,000** | 62% decline |
| Without PMTCT | 350,000 | 3x higher |

### Treatment Coverage
| Metric | 2010 | 2024 | Change |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-------|
| Pregnant women on ART | 50% | **84%** | +34 points |
| MTCT rate | 23% | **10%** | -13 points |

## Regional Distribution

### Infections Averted by Region
| Region | Percentage |
|:-------|:-----------|
| Eastern and Southern Africa | **79%** |
| Western and Central Africa | 14% |
| Other regions | 7% |

### Regional Challenges
| Region | Status |
|:-------|:-------|
| ESAR | Major progress, approaching EMTCT |
| WCAR | Slower progress, gaps remain |
| Asia Pacific | Variable by country |
| Latin America | Near elimination |

---

## Remaining Challenges

### Causes of Ongoing Transmission
| Cause | Contribution (2024) |
|:------|:-------------------|
| Mother not receiving ART | **65% of new infections** |
| ART dropout during pregnancy | Significant factor |
| Dropout during breastfeeding | Critical period |

> "Almost 65 percent of new HIV infections among children in 2024 were due to the mother not receiving ART or dropping off from ART during either pregnancy or breastfeeding."

### Barriers to Elimination
| Barrier | Impact |
|:--------|:-------|
| Healthcare access | Remote/underserved areas |
| Stigma | Prevents testing uptake |
| Supply chain | ART availability |
| Follow-up | Retention in care |

---

## UNAIDS 2030 Targets

### Elimination Goals
| Target | Status |
|:-------|:-------|
| New child infections | <10,000/year |
| MTCT rate | <2% (non-breastfeeding) |
| MTCT rate | <5% (breastfeeding) |
| Assessment | **Not on track** |

> "Progress is not fast enough to reach the 2030 targets set by UNAIDS and partners."

## Evidence-Based Interventions

### Current PMTCT Components
| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| Option B+ | Lifelong ART for all pregnant women with HIV |
| Early infant diagnosis | PCR testing at 4-6 weeks |
| Infant prophylaxis | Nevirapine/AZT for exposed infants |
| Safe feeding counseling | Exclusive breastfeeding with ART |

### Emerging Approaches
| Innovation | Potential |
|:-----------|:----------|
| Long-acting ARVs | Improved adherence |
| Point-of-care testing | Faster diagnosis |
| Community health workers | Better retention |
| mHealth interventions | Follow-up support |

## Successful Country Examples

### Elimination Certified Countries
| Country | Year Certified |
|:--------|:---------------|
| Cuba | 2015 |
| Thailand | 2016 |
| Belarus | 2016 |
| Armenia | 2016 |
| Moldova | 2016 |

## Relevance to Project

PMTCT epidemiology informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Transmission dynamics**: Mother-child sequence comparisons
- **Selection pressure**: Drug exposure during transmission
- **Bottleneck effects**: Founder virus characteristics
- **Population surveillance**: Tracking circulating variants
