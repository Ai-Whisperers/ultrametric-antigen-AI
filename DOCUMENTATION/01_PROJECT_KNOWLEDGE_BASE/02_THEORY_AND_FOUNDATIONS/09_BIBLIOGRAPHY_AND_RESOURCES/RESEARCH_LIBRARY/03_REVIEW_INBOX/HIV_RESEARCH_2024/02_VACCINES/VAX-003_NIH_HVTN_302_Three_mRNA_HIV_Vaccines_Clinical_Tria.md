# HVTN 302: NIH Phase 1 Trial of Three mRNA HIV Vaccines

**ID:** VAX-003
**Year:** 2024
**Sponsor:** NIAID/NIH
**Trial ID:** NCT05217641
**Partners:** Scripps Research, IAVI, Moderna
**Sites:** 11 US locations

---

## Abstract

HVTN 302 represents a landmark Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating three experimental HIV vaccines based on mRNA technology—the same platform used in highly successful COVID-19 vaccines. Conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), this trial tests the safety and immunogenicity of three related BG505 MD39.3 mRNA vaccine candidates designed to present stabilized HIV envelope trimers.

## Key Concepts

- **mRNA vaccine platform**: Genetic material encoding HIV proteins, enabling rapid production
- **BG505 MD39.3**: Stabilized HIV envelope trimer design
- **Germline targeting**: Strategy to activate bnAb precursor B cells
- **Tier 2 neutralization**: Ability to neutralize difficult-to-neutralize HIV strains

## Vaccine Candidates

### Three mRNA Formulations Tested
| Candidate | Design | Target |
|:----------|:-------|:-------|
| BG505 MD39.3 mRNA | Full trimer | Standard presentation |
| BG505 MD39.3 gp151 mRNA | Truncated | Modified presentation |
| BG505 MD39.3 gp151 CD4KO mRNA | CD4 binding site knockout | Focused epitope |

### Development Partners
- **Scripps CHAVD**: Sequence design
- **IAVI NAC**: Antibody center collaboration
- **Moderna**: mRNA formulation and manufacturing

## Trial Design

### Enrollment
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Participants | Up to 108 adults |
| Age range | 18-55 years |
| Sites | 11 US locations |
| Principal investigators | Jesse Clark (UCLA), Sharon Riddler (Pittsburgh) |

### Dosing Groups
| Group | Vaccine | Dose | Schedule |
|:------|:--------|:-----|:---------|
| A1-A3 | Each candidate | 100 mcg | Months 0, 2, 6 |
| B1-B3 | Each candidate | 250 mcg | Months 0, 2, 6 |

## Key Findings

### Immunogenicity
| Outcome | Result |
|:--------|:-------|
| Neutralizing antibodies | Tier 2 responses elicited |
| Response rate | 80% developed neutralizing antibodies |
| Antibody duration | Detectable at 6 months post-vaccination |
| Dose response | Higher with 3rd dose |

### Unique mRNA Platform Advantages
1. **Rapid production** compared to protein vaccines
2. **Strong immunogenicity** demonstrated
3. **Membrane-anchored presentation** mimics native virus
4. **Scalable manufacturing** for global deployment

## Safety Profile

### Adverse Events
| Event Type | Incidence | Severity |
|:-----------|:----------|:---------|
| Urticaria (hives) | 7-18% across trials | Mostly mild-moderate |
| Chronic urticaria | ~6.5% | Required management |
| Hospitalization | 2 participants | Short-term |
| Serious AEs | Rare | No unexpected patterns |

### Safety Publication
A detailed safety analysis was published in Annals of Internal Medicine (2025):
> "High frequency of chronic urticaria following an investigational HIV-1 BG505 MD39.3 trimer mRNA vaccine"

### Management
- Most cases managed with **antihistamines**
- Safety monitoring ongoing
- Does not preclude continued development

## Significance

### Milestones
1. **First mRNA HIV vaccines** in Phase 1 human trials
2. **Proof-of-concept** that mRNA platform works for HIV
3. **Foundation** for next-generation candidates
4. **Platform validation** for rapid vaccine iteration

### Comparison to Protein Vaccines
| Feature | mRNA | Protein |
|:--------|:-----|:--------|
| Production speed | Faster | Slower |
| Immunogenicity | Comparable or better | Reference |
| Manufacturing | Scalable | Complex |
| Iteration | Rapid sequence updates | Slower modification |

## Next Steps

| Phase | Plans |
|:------|:------|
| Safety optimization | Address urticaria signals |
| Immunogen refinement | Optimize trimer design |
| Combination trials | Test with adjuvants or boosters |
| Phase 2 | Larger efficacy-focused trials |

## Relevance to Project

HVTN 302 informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Envelope sequences**: BG505 as model for immunogen design
- **Trimer stability**: Sequence features affecting protein folding
- **Neutralization breadth**: Predicting epitope exposure
- **Platform comparison**: mRNA vs protein sequence requirements
