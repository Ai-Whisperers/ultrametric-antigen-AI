## Abstract

In a Phase 1 clinical trial, 108 HIV-negative adults aged 18-55 years at 10 U.S. sites received three doses of one of six regimens. Three immunizations with membrane-anchored trimers elicited neutralizing antibodies in 80% of recipients.

## Key Concepts

- **mRNA Vaccine Platform**: Similar technology to COVID-19 vaccines
- **Membrane-Anchored Trimers**: Native-like HIV envelope presentation
- **Tier 2 Neutralizing Antibodies**: Antibodies effective against harder-to-neutralize HIV strains
- **bnAb Pathway**: Strategy to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies

## Trial Results

| Metric | Result |
|:-------|:-------|
| Participants | 108 HIV-negative adults |
| Response Rate | 80% developed neutralizing antibodies |
| Onset | Responses appeared after second dose |
| Duration | Antibodies detectable 6 months post-final vaccination |

---

## Main Findings

1. mRNA platform enabled faster production and clinical testing
2. Strong immune responses achieved with membrane-anchored trimers
3. Neutralizing responses increased in magnitude following third dose
4. Serum antibody titers remained detectable at 6 months

---

## Safety Considerations

- Higher incidence of urticaria compared to other Moderna mRNA vaccines
- About 6.5% of participants developed chronic hives
- Most cases mild to moderate, improved with antihistamines
- Two participants required short-term hospitalization

---

## Significance

This represents a major milestone in HIV vaccine development:
- First demonstration that mRNA vaccines can induce HIV-neutralizing antibodies
- Proof-of-concept for pathway to broadly neutralizing antibodies
- Platform can be rapidly adapted for different immunogen designs

---

## Relevance to Project

The vaccine targets HIV envelope proteins (gp120/gp41), which are subject to:
- High mutation rates requiring sequence diversity analysis
- Codon usage patterns affecting expression
- Structural constraints on viable mutations
