## Abstract

Germline-targeting (GT) vaccine strategies use engineered nanoparticles displaying epitope scaffolds designed to activate rare naive B cells with broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) potential. The eOD-GT8 60mer nanoparticle, delivered via mRNA, has demonstrated 94% induction of VRC01-class bnAb precursors in clinical trials, validating this revolutionary approach to HIV vaccine development.

## Key Concepts

- **Germline Targeting**: Vaccines designed to activate bnAb precursor B cells
- **eOD-GT8**: Engineered Outer Domain designed to bind germline VRC01
- **60mer Nanoparticle**: Self-assembling particle with 60 antigen copies
- **Somatic Hypermutation (SHM)**: B cell mutation required for bnAb maturation
- **VRC01-class**: bnAbs targeting HIV CD4 binding site

## The Germline-Targeting Challenge

### Why Traditional Vaccines Fail
| Problem | Explanation |
|:--------|:------------|
| Rare precursors | VRC01-class B cells are ~1 in 300,000 |
| Low affinity | Germline antibodies don't bind HIV well |
| Glycan shielding | Env blocks antibody access |
| Rapid evolution | HIV mutates faster than immunity develops |

### GT Solution
```
Engineer immunogen → Binds germline bnAb precursors →
Activate rare B cells → Sequential boosting →
Guide SHM → Mature to bnAb
```

## eOD-GT8 60mer Design

### Structure
| Component | Function |
|:----------|:---------|
| eOD (Engineered Outer Domain) | Core epitope scaffold |
| GT8 mutations | Optimized for germline VRC01 binding |
| Lumazine synthase core | Self-assembles into 60mer |
| Multivalent display | 60 copies per particle |

### Engineering Strategy
| Feature | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|
| Removed glycans | Expose CD4bs epitope |
| Stabilized conformation | Maintain native-like structure |
| Enhanced affinity | Bind low-affinity germline BCRs |

## Clinical Trial Results (2024-2025)

### IAVI G001 Trial (Protein)
| Outcome | Result |
|:--------|:-------|
| VRC01-class precursor induction | 97% of participants |
| SHM levels | Baseline induction |
| Platform | Adjuvanted protein |

### IAVI G002/G003 Trials (mRNA)
| Outcome | G002 (North America) | G003 (Africa) |
|:--------|:---------------------|:---------------|
| Precursor induction | **94%** | **94%** |
| SHM levels | **2x higher than G001** | Comparable |
| Elite responders (boosted) | **>80%** | — |

> "mRNA immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer induced bnAb precursors with high consistency (in 94% of recipients in each trial), substantial frequencies, and high SHM."

## mRNA Delivery Advantage

### Comparison: Protein vs mRNA
| Parameter | Protein (G001) | mRNA (G002/G003) |
|:----------|:---------------|:-----------------|
| Precursor induction | 97% | 94% |
| SHM levels | Baseline | **2-fold higher** |
| Manufacturing speed | Months | Weeks |
| Production scale | Limited | Highly scalable |

### mRNA Platform Benefits
| Advantage | Significance |
|:----------|:-------------|
| COVID-19 technology | Proven at scale |
| Rapid iteration | Quick design changes |
| Strong immune response | Enhanced SHM induction |
| Global deployment | Manufacturing capacity |

## Boosting Strategy

### Heterologous Prime-Boost
| Phase | Immunogen | Function |
|:------|:----------|:---------|
| Prime | eOD-GT8 60mer (mRNA-1644) | Activate precursors |
| Boost | core-g28v2 60mer (mRNA-1644v2-core) | Drive maturation |

### Optimization Finding
| Regimen | Elite Response Rate |
|:--------|:-------------------|
| One prime only | Lower |
| Two primes + boost | Good |
| **One prime + one boost** | **Best** |

## Safety Profile

### Adverse Events
| Trial | Skin Reactions | Management |
|:------|:---------------|:-----------|
| G002 | 18% (urticaria in 11.7%) | Antihistamines |
| G003 | 11% mild itching, no urticaria | Minimal |

### Dose Optimization
> "A follow-up study is planned in South Africa to evaluate the same prime-boost approach tested in G002, but at a lower dose."

## Path to bnAb Elicitation

### Sequential Immunization Strategy
```
Prime (eOD-GT8) → VRC01-class activation →
Boost 1 (core-g28v2) → SHM advancement →
Boost 2+ (native-like trimer) → bnAb maturation →
Final boost (diverse Envs) → Breadth development
```

### Consortium Plans (2025)
| Initiative | Details |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Funding | Gates Foundation |
| Leadership | IAVI |
| Goal | Additional GT immunogens for other bnAb classes |
