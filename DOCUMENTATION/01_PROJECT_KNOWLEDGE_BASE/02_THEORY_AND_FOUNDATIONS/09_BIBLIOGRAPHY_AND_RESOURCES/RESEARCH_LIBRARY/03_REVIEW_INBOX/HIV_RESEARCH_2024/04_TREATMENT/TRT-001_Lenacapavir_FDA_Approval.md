## Abstract

The U.S. FDA has approved Yeztugo (lenacapavir)—Gilead's injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor—as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35kg.

**Named Science Magazine's 2024 Breakthrough of the Year**

---

## Key Concepts

- **Capsid Inhibitor**: Novel mechanism targeting HIV-1 capsid protein
- **Long-Acting Injectable**: Twice-yearly subcutaneous injection
- **PrEP**: Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention
- **Breakthrough**: First and only 6-month HIV prevention option

## Clinical Trial Data

### PURPOSE 1 Trial (Cisgender Women)
| Metric | Result |
|:-------|:-------|
| Participants | 2,134 females aged 16-25 |
| Location | South Africa, Uganda |
| HIV Infections | Zero (100% reduction) |
| Comparison | Superior to daily oral Truvada |

### PURPOSE 2 Trial (MSM/Transgender)
| Metric | Result |
|:-------|:-------|
| Participants | 2,180 on lenacapavir |
| HIV Prevention | 96% reduction |
| HIV Cases | Only 2 (vs 9 on daily oral) |
| Location | 88 sites in 7 countries |

## Mechanism of Action

Lenacapavir is a first-in-class HIV capsid inhibitor that:
1. Interferes with capsid-mediated nuclear uptake of HIV
2. Blocks virus assembly and release
3. Has a novel multistage mechanism of action
4. High barrier to resistance development

## Global Access

| Initiative | Details |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Price Target | $40 USD per person per year (generic) |
| Countries | 120 countries eligible |
| Manufacturers | Two generic manufacturers (Gates/Unitaid) |
| Timeline | Supply from late 2025, service delivery 2026 |
| Commitment | 2 million people over 3 years (Global Fund/PEPFAR) |

## WHO Recommendation

> "While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk." - Dr. Tedros, WHO Director-General

---

## Once-Yearly Development

- Phase 1 trial shows plasma concentrations remain above effective levels for 56+ weeks
- Phase 3 trial for yearly formulation launched 2025, expected completion 2028
- Could further simplify HIV prevention

---

## Relevance to Project

Lenacapavir's capsid-targeting mechanism relates to:
- Capsid protein sequence and structural constraints
- Resistance mutation patterns in CA gene
- Codon usage affecting capsid assembly
