# LATITUDE Trial: Long-Acting Cabenuva Superior to Daily Oral ART

**ID:** TRT-010
**Year:** 2024
**Sponsor:** ViiV Healthcare, NIAID, ACTG
**Journal:** Clinical Infectious Diseases
**Conference:** CROI 2024
**Trial ID:** LATITUDE (Long-Acting Therapy to Improve Treatment Success in Daily Life)

---

## Abstract

The LATITUDE Phase 3 trial demonstrated that monthly long-acting injectable Cabenuva (cabotegravir + rilpivirine) showed superior efficacy compared to daily oral therapy in people with HIV who have a history of adherence challenges. The study's Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended all participants be offered long-acting therapy based on clear evidence of superiority.

## Key Concepts

- **Cabenuva**: Monthly injectable combination (cabotegravir + rilpivirine)
- **Adherence challenges**: Difficulty maintaining daily medication regimens
- **Regimen failure**: Combination of virologic failures and discontinuations
- **DSMB**: Data Safety Monitoring Board recommendation

## Trial Design

| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Design | Phase 3, randomized, open-label |
| Sites | 31 US sites including Puerto Rico |
| Network | ACTG (Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally) |
| Sponsor | NIAID with ViiV Healthcare, Janssen support |
| Population | Adults with HIV and adherence challenges |

### Eligibility
- Prior history of difficulty adhering to daily ART
- Required to achieve viral suppression with adherence support before randomization

---

## Participant Demographics

| Characteristic | Percentage |
|:---------------|:-----------|
| Male | 40% |
| Black/African American | 64% |
| Hispanic | 17% |
| Transgender | 5% |
| Current/former injection drug users | 14% |
| Median age | 40 years |

## Results

### Primary Endpoint: Regimen Failure
| Arm | N | Regimen Failure Rate |
|:----|:--|:--------------------|
| **Long-acting Cabenuva** | 146 | **24.1%** |
| Daily oral standard of care | 148 | 38.5% |

**Relative reduction**: 37% lower regimen failure with LA-ART

### DSMB Recommendation
> "The DSMB concluded that the evidence indicated superior efficacy of long-acting ART over daily oral standard of care. The DSMB recommended that all eligible participants should be offered long-acting injectable cabotegravir + rilpivirine."

## Safety Profile

| Finding | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Overall AE rate | Similar between arms |
| Serious injection site reactions | 3 participants (LA-ART arm) |
| Discontinuation due to ISR | 1 participant |
| Virologic failures with new RAMs | 2 per arm |
| New INSTI RAMs | 2 in LA-ART participants |

## Clinical Implications

### Guideline Changes
Following LATITUDE results, major guidelines now recommend:
- **IAS-USA**: Consider LA CAB/RPV in select PWH with viremia due to adherence challenges
- **DHHS**: Long-acting options for patients unable to achieve suppression on oral ART

### Target Population
| Characteristic | Benefit of LA-ART |
|:---------------|:------------------|
| Unstable housing | Reduced daily pill burden |
| Substance use | Monthly appointments vs daily dosing |
| Mental health challenges | Simplified regimen |
| Work schedules | Flexible appointment-based dosing |
| Stigma concerns | Discrete monthly injections |

---

## Comparison: Treatment Modalities

| Feature | Daily Oral | Monthly LA-ART |
|:--------|:-----------|:---------------|
| Doses/year | 365 | 12 |
| Daily reminder needed | Yes | No |
| Clinic visits | Variable | Monthly |
| Regimen failure (LATITUDE) | 38.5% | 24.1% |
| Ideal for adherence challenges | No | **Yes** |

---

## Significance

### Key Findings
1. **First evidence** of superiority for LA-ART in adherence-challenged population
2. **Real-world applicability**: Recruited participants with actual adherence difficulties
3. **Health equity**: 64% Black participants, addressing disparities
4. **DSMB decision**: Early recommendation based on clear benefit

### Quote
> "These data support the use of long-acting injectable ART as a strategy to improve outcomes for individuals living with HIV who face challenges with daily oral therapy adherence."

## Relevance to Project

The LATITUDE trial informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Drug targets**: Cabotegravir (INSTI) and rilpivirine (NNRTI) binding sites
- **Resistance emergence**: Patterns in treatment-experienced patients
- **Sequence conservation**: Critical residues for LA-ART activity
- **Adherence biology**: Understanding viral evolution during suboptimal therapy
