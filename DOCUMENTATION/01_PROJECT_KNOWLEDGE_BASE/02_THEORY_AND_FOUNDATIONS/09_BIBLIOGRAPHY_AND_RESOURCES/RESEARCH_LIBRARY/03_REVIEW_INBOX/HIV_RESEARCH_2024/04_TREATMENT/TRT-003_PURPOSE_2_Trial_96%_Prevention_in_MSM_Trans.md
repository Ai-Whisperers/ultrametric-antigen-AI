## Abstract

PURPOSE 2 is a landmark Phase 3 trial demonstrating that twice-yearly injectable lenacapavir reduced HIV acquisition by 96% among cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men, and gender non-binary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth. With only 2 HIV infections among 2,180 participants receiving lenacapavir (99.9% remaining HIV-free), this trial confirms lenacapavir's extraordinary efficacy across diverse populations.

## Key Concepts

- **Lenacapavir**: First-in-class HIV-1 capsid inhibitor
- **Twice-yearly injection**: Subcutaneous administration every 26 weeks
- **Gender-inclusive**: First major PrEP trial to intentionally include transgender and non-binary individuals
- **Global trial**: 88 sites across 7 countries

## Significance

### Historic Firsts
1. **First trial** to intentionally include adolescents in Phase 3 PrEP study
2. **First trial** to intentionally enroll >20% gender-diverse individuals
3. **Largest trial** of PrEP in transgender populations
4. **89% superiority** over current standard-of-care (daily oral PrEP)

### Expert Commentary
> "These findings build upon the earlier results from PURPOSE 1, which demonstrated lenacapavir's efficacy in cisgender women. Together, these trials provide compelling evidence for the potential of lenacapavir to transform HIV prevention globally, across diverse populations."

## Comparison: PURPOSE 1 vs PURPOSE 2

| Feature | PURPOSE 1 | PURPOSE 2 |
|:--------|:----------|:----------|
| Population | Cisgender women | MSM, trans, NB persons |
| Location | Africa | Global (7 countries) |
| Efficacy | 100% | 96% |
| HIV infections (LEN) | 0 | 2 |
| Comparator | F/TAF, F/TDF | TDF/FTC |

## Relevance to Project

PURPOSE 2 informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Capsid targeting**: Lenacapavir binds conserved CA protein
- **Resistance monitoring**: Critical for emerging Q67H, K70R mutations
- **Diverse populations**: Understanding HIV sequence diversity across demographics
- **Prevention efficacy**: Near-elimination validates capsid as drug target
