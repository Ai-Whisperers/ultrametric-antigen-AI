## Abstract

EBT-101 is the first gene therapy administered intravenously designed to attack the latent HIV proviral genome using an adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) CRISPR-Cas9 multiplex system. This Phase 1/2 trial (EBT-101-001) evaluated safety and preliminary efficacy in people living with HIV.

## Key Concepts

- **CRISPR-Cas9**: Gene-editing technology to excise HIV provirus from host genome
- **AAV9 Delivery**: Adeno-associated virus vector for systemic delivery
- **Latent Reservoir**: Targeting cells with dormant HIV provirus
- **Viral Rebound**: Return of detectable viral load after ART interruption

---

## Trial Design

- **Participants**: 6 patients split between two dose-level groups
- **Doses**: 0.9 x 10^12 and 3 x 10^12 vector genes per kg
- **Endpoint**: Viral suppression after ART interruption
- **FDA Status**: Fast Track Designation (July 2023)

## Results

1. **Safety**: Treatment was safe and well-tolerated with promising safety profile
2. **Viral Rebound**: HIV RNA levels rebounded in all four participants who stopped ART
3. **Delayed Rebound**: One patient maintained viral suppression for 16 weeks (significantly longer than typical 2-4 weeks)
4. **Reservoir Reduction**: "Quite varied decreases" in HIV latent reservoir among participants

## Key Quotes

> "This study is highly unique. It was a high-risk study that showed a very promising safety profile." - Chantelle Ahlenstiel, PhD, Kirby Institute

> "Those exploratory endpoints promise that maybe there was some effect in at least one participant, and we're trying to figure out what was different about that person." - Presti

## Challenges Identified

1. Percentage of latently infected cells in humans much lower than in preclinical models
2. EBT-101 may not have reached all cells with latent HIV at initial dose
3. Need for gRNAs highly conserved across all HIV subtypes for global applicability

---

## Next Steps

- Higher dose testing in progress
- Exploring new CRISPR delivery methods including lipid nanoparticles
- Next-generation products with improved targeting efficiency

---

## Relevance to Project

This trial provides critical data on HIV genome editing approaches, relevant to understanding:
- Provirus integration sites and their accessibility
- Viral sequence diversity challenges for therapeutic targeting
- Importance of subtype-specific sequence analysis
