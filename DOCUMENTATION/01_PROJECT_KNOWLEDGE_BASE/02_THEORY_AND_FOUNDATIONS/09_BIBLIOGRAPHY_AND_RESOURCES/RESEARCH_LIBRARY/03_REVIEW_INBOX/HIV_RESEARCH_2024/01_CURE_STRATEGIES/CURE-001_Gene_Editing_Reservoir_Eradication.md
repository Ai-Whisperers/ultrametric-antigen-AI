## Abstract

Recent advances in virology have significantly progressed the pursuit of a definitive cure for HIV. Emerging therapeutic strategies encompass innovative gene-editing technologies, immune-modulatory interventions, and next-generation antiretroviral agents. Efforts to eliminate or control viral reservoirs have also gained momentum.

## Key Concepts

- **Gene Editing**: CRISPR-Cas9 and other technologies for excising integrated HIV provirus
- **Immune Modulation**: Enhancing host immune responses to clear infected cells
- **Reservoir Eradication**: Strategies targeting latently infected CD4+ T cells and macrophages
- **Combination Approaches**: Integrating multiple therapeutic modalities

## Main Findings

1. Gene-editing technologies show promise for targeting integrated HIV provirus
2. Combination therapies integrating ARVs, bnAbs, and gene editing offer comprehensive attack strategies
3. Novel antiretroviral agents with different mechanisms of action are expanding treatment options
4. T cell receptor (TCR) agents are emerging as a promising avenue to eliminate viral reservoirs
