## Abstract

This comprehensive 2024 review examines the current landscape of HIV cure research, focusing on the mechanisms of viral persistence, characteristics of the latent reservoir, and emerging therapeutic strategies. The review synthesizes advances in shock-and-kill, block-and-lock, gene editing, and immunotherapy approaches while addressing the unique challenges posed by tissue reservoirs and myeloid cell infection.

## Key Concepts

- **HIV Persistence**: Continued presence of replication-competent virus despite suppressive ART
- **Latent Reservoir**: Cells harboring integrated, transcriptionally silent but reactivatable HIV
- **Functional Cure**: Sustained ART-free remission (not necessarily eradication)
- **Sterilizing Cure**: Complete elimination of all replication-competent virus

## Current Understanding of Latency

### Primary Reservoir Characteristics
| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Main cell type | Resting memory CD4+ T cells |
| Estimated size | ~10^6 cells in treated patients |
| Half-life | 44 months (extremely stable) |
| Establishment | Within days of infection |
| Key location | Lymphoid tissues (>95%) |

### Additional Reservoirs
| Cell Type | Evidence | Challenges |
|:----------|:---------|:-----------|
| Tissue macrophages | DNA + replication-competent virus | Tissue access, long-lived |
| Brain microglia | Detected post-mortem | Blood-brain barrier |
| Gut-associated T cells | High HIV DNA | Poor drug penetration |
| Lymph node follicular cells | Protected from CTLs | Anatomical barrier |

## Key Challenges

### Scientific Challenges
| Challenge | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| Reservoir heterogeneity | Multiple cell types, anatomical sites |
| Measurement limitations | Difficult to quantify replication-competent virus |
| Tissue access | Many reservoirs in hard-to-reach sites |
| Myeloid reservoirs | LRAs ineffective in macrophages |

### Clinical Challenges
| Challenge | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| ATI risks | Treatment interruption dangerous |
| Biomarkers | No reliable predictors of rebound |
| Scale | Strategies must work for 39 million people |
| Durability | Long-term follow-up needed |

## Recent Breakthroughs

### Cure Cases (Stem Cell Transplants)
| Patient | Year | Key Feature |
|:--------|:-----|:------------|
| Berlin | 2008 | First cure, CCR5Δ32 donor |
| London | 2019 | CCR5Δ32, milder conditioning |
| Geneva | 2024 | First without CCR5Δ32 (alloimmunity) |

### Elite Controllers
> "The quality, rather than the quantity, of viral reservoirs can be an important distinguishing feature for a functional cure."

## Future Directions

### Combination Approaches
1. **LRA + bnAbs**: Reactivate and clear
2. **Gene editing + immunotherapy**: Excise and prevent rebound
3. **Block-and-lock + shock-and-kill**: Silence resistant cells, kill reactivated cells

### Emerging Technologies
- In vivo CRISPR delivery optimization
- Long-acting bnAb formulations
- Next-generation LRAs targeting myeloid cells
- Stem cell transplant refinements

## Relevance to Project

This review informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Reservoir sequences**: Understanding persisting viral populations
- **Latency mechanisms**: LTR and Tat sequences affecting silencing
- **Drug targets**: Conserved sequences for therapeutic targeting
- **Cure prediction**: Sequence features associated with rebound
