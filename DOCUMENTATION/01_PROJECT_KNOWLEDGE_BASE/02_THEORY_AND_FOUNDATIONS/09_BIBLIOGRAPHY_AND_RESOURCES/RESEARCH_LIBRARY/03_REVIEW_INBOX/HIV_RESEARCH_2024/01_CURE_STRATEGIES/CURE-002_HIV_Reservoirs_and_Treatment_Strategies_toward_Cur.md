## Abstract

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition. However, while cART can reduce viral production to below the detection limit, it fails to eliminate integrated viral DNA from latently infected cells. This comprehensive review examines the biology of HIV reservoirs and therapeutic strategies aimed at achieving a cure or sustained remission, focusing on two primary approaches: "Shock and Kill" and "Block and Lock."

## Key Concepts

- **Latent Reservoir**: Long-lived CD4+ T cells harboring integrated, replication-competent HIV provirus
- **Shock and Kill**: Using latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to reactivate latent HIV, followed by immune-mediated clearance
- **Block and Lock**: Inducing deep, permanent latency using latency-promoting agents (LPAs)
- **Combination ART**: Suppressive therapy that controls but does not eliminate HIV

## Main Findings

### Reservoir Characteristics
| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Primary Cell Type | Resting memory CD4+ T cells |
| Half-Life | 44 months (extremely long-lived) |
| Size | ~10^6 cells in treated patients |
| Location | Blood, lymph nodes, gut, CNS |

### Cure Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Mechanism | Advantages | Challenges |
|:---------|:----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Shock and Kill | LRAs reactivate virus; immune system clears infected cells | Aims for complete elimination | LRAs may not reactivate all cells; immune exhaustion |
| Block and Lock | LPAs induce permanent silencing | No need to eliminate all cells | Provirus remains; durability unknown |

### Latency-Reversing Agents (LRAs)

1. **HDAC Inhibitors**: Vorinostat, romidepsin, panobinostat
2. **PKC Agonists**: Bryostatin, ingenol derivatives
3. **BET Inhibitors**: JQ1 and derivatives
4. **TLR Agonists**: TLR7/8 agonists (vesatolimod)

### Block and Lock Agents

1. **dCA (didehydro-Cortistatin A)**: Tat inhibitor
2. **LEDGINs**: LEDGF/p75-IN interaction inhibitors
3. **BRD4 Modulators**: ZL0580 and related compounds

## Clinical Implications

> "cART can reduce viral production in the body of the patient to below the detection limit, but it fails to eliminate integrated viral DNA."

The persistence of latently infected cells means:
- Lifelong treatment required with current therapies
- Treatment interruption leads to viral rebound within weeks
- Cure strategies must target these reservoir cells

## Relevance to Project

This review is fundamental for the Ternary VAE project:
- **Reservoir biology**: Understanding which sequences persist in latency
- **Selection pressures**: Drug pressure vs latency selection
- **Mutation patterns**: Sequences that escape immune clearance
- **Therapeutic targets**: Proteins critical for latency reversal/maintenance
