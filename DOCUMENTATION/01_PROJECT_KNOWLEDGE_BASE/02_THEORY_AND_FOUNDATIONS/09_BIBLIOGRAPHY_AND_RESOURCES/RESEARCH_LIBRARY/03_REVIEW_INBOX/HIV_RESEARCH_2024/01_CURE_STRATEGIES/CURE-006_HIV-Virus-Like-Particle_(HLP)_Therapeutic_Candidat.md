## Abstract

In March 2024, an international research team led by Professor Eric Arts (Schulich School of Medicine) and Dr. Jamie Mann (University of Bristol) demonstrated that their patented HIV-Virus-Like-Particle (HLP) is 100 times more effective than other candidate HIV cure therapeutics at targeting and eliminating the latent HIV reservoir in people on long-term antiretroviral therapy.

## Key Concepts

- **HLP**: HIV-Virus-Like-Particle (deactivated HIV structural mimetic)
- **Latent Reservoir**: Dormant HIV integrated in resting CD4+ T cells
- **Shock and Kill**: Strategy to reactivate then eliminate latent cells
- **cART**: Combined antiretroviral therapy (lifelong suppression)

## The HLP Approach

### What is HLP?
| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| Structure | Deactivated version of HIV |
| Contains | Viral proteins for immune recognition |
| Lacks | Replication machinery (safe) |
| Function | Triggers immune targeting of HIV |

### Mechanism of Action
```
HLP administration → Immune recognition of HIV proteins →
Activation of immune response →
Targeting latent reservoir cells →
"Shock" (latency reversal) + "Kill" (immune clearance) →
Reservoir purge
```

## Study Design

### Patient Population
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Participants | 32 people living with chronic HIV |
| Countries | USA, Uganda, Canada |
| ART duration | Median ~13 years on stable cART |
| Sample type | Blood samples |

### Key Finding
> "HLP was able to specifically target just the immune cells containing latent HIV reservoir and purge these cells of their HIV, a critical step towards an HIV-1 cure."

---

## Efficacy Results

### Comparative Effectiveness
| Measure | HLP Performance |
|:--------|:----------------|
| vs other LRAs | **100x more effective** |
| Specificity | Targets only HIV-infected cells |
| Latency reversal | Confirmed in chronic cases |
| Safety signal | No concerning toxicity |

### Subtype Coverage
| Finding | Significance |
|:--------|:-------------|
| Multiple HIV subtypes tested | Global applicability potential |
| Cross-subtype activity | Works on variants worldwide |
| Geographic diversity | US, Uganda, Canada samples |

---

## Advantages Over Current Approaches

### Comparison with Other LRAs
| Feature | HLP | Traditional LRAs (e.g., HDACi) |
|:--------|:----|:-------------------------------|
| Specificity | HIV-infected cells only | Broad effects |
| Toxicity | Minimal | Significant concerns |
| Effectiveness | 100x superior | Moderate |
| Immune activation | Targeted | May impair NK cells |

### Long-Term ART Compatibility
> "One concern expressed among people living with HIV for years is that continued use of cART could lead to the virus becoming unreachable. The results demonstrate that combining HLP with cART is still able to trigger the latent reservoir, even in chronic cases."

---

## Global Applicability

### Subtype Testing
| Subtype | Status |
|:--------|:-------|
| Subtype B | Tested (US, Canada) |
| Subtype A/D | Tested (Uganda) |
| Subtype C | Planned (South Africa, Ethiopia, India, Vietnam) |

### Researcher Quote
> "We were excited to see preliminary evidence that our HLP cure therapy reverses latency irrespective of the subtype of the individual's infection. Whilst this needs to be explored further, it hints at the global applicability of our approach."

## Development Pathway

### Current Status
| Phase | Activity |
|:------|:---------|
| Preclinical | Completed |
| Toxicity studies | Ongoing |
| Larger cohort testing | Planned (Subtype C) |
| Human clinical trials | Preparation underway |

### Future Plans
| Step | Details |
|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | Confirm lack of toxicity |
| 2 | Test in larger subtype C cohort |
| 3 | Initiate Phase I human trials |
| 4 | Global deployment if successful |

## Research Team

### Lead Investigators
| Researcher | Institution | Role |
|:-----------|:------------|:-----|
| Prof. Eric Arts | Schulich School of Medicine, Western University | Co-lead |
| Dr. Jamie Mann | University of Bristol | Co-lead |
| Minh Ha Ngo | First author | Primary researcher |

## Significance

### Public Health Impact
> "If successful in clinical trials, HLP could be used by millions of people living around the world to free them of HIV."

### Key Innovations
1. **Specificity**: Targets only HIV-infected cells
2. **Potency**: 100x more effective than alternatives
3. **Safety**: No replication-competent virus
4. **Breadth**: Works across HIV subtypes

## Relevance to Project

HLP research informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Envelope sequences**: Immunogenic regions for recognition
- **Latency markers**: Sequences associated with reservoir cells
- **Subtype conservation**: Cross-reactive epitope identification
- **Therapeutic targets**: Sequence-based cure strategy design
