## Abstract

A landmark clinical trial evaluated a triple combination of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) PGT121, PGDM1400, and VRC07-523LS in both HIV-negative individuals and people living with HIV (PLWH) during ART interruption.

## Key Concepts

- **Triple bnAb Combination**: Using three non-overlapping epitope-targeting antibodies
- **ART Interruption**: Testing viral control without antiretroviral drugs
- **Virologic Suppression**: Maintaining undetectable viral load
- **Escape Prevention**: Combining targets to prevent viral escape

## Study Design

### Part 1: Safety (HIV-negative)
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Participants | 6 adults without HIV |
| Purpose | Safety and tolerability evaluation |

### Part 2: Efficacy (PLWH)
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Participants | 12 people living with HIV |
| Intervention | Up to 6 monthly infusions of triple bnAbs |
| Design | ART interruption during antibody therapy |

---

## Key Results

| Outcome | Result |
|:--------|:-------|
| Virologic Suppression During Therapy | 83% (10/12 participants) |
| Extended Suppression (38-44 weeks) | 42% (5/12 participants) |
| Durability | Suppression continued despite declining antibody levels |

---

## Significance

1. **Proof-of-Concept**: Triple bnAb combination can maintain viral suppression without ART
2. **Extended Control**: Some participants maintained control for nearly a year
3. **Synergy**: Combining multiple epitope targets prevents viral escape
4. **Future Direction**: Supports development of bnAb-based cure strategies

## bnAb Targets

| Antibody | Target Epitope |
|:---------|:---------------|
| PGT121 | V3-glycan on gp120 |
| PGDM1400 | V1V2 apex |
| VRC07-523LS | CD4 binding site |

## Implications for Cure Research

> "These results suggest that bnAb combinations could be a component of future HIV cure strategies, potentially working alongside other interventions like therapeutic vaccines or latency-reversing agents."

---

## Relevance to Project

This research directly relates to:
- Understanding envelope glycoprotein epitopes
- Sequence variability affecting antibody binding
- Structural constraints on escape mutations
- Codon usage patterns in targeted regions
