## Abstract

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) studies of native HIV-1 capsid cores have revealed how host factors IP6 (inositol hexakisphosphate) and cyclophilin A (CypA) regulate capsid stability and nuclear import. Recent 2024-2025 breakthroughs demonstrate that HIV-1 nuclear import depends on both capsid elasticity and nuclear pore adaptability, with the intact conical core passing through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) as an opportunistic nuclear transport receptor.

## Key Concepts

- **IP6 (Inositol Hexakisphosphate)**: Polyanion stabilizing capsid lattice
- **Cyclophilin A (CypA)**: Host factor regulating capsid stability
- **CPSF6**: Cleavage and polyadenylation factor involved in nuclear import
- **Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC)**: Gateway for HIV capsid nuclear entry
- **Cryo-ET**: Cryo-electron tomography for structural analysis

## IP6 as Capsid Stabilizer

### Role of IP6
| Function | Mechanism |
|:---------|:----------|
| Lattice stabilization | Binds central pore of CA hexamers |
| Assembly promotion | Facilitates capsid maturation |
| Stability maintenance | Prevents premature uncoating |
| Concentration-dependent | ~10 μM cellular concentration |

### Binding Site
```
CA hexamer → Central pore → IP6 binding →
Electrostatic stabilization → Intact capsid lattice
```

## Cyclophilin A Interactions

### CypA Binding to Capsid
| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Binding site | CypA loop on CA NTD |
| Function | Regulates capsid stability |
| Effect | Modulates uncoating timing |
| Clinical relevance | CypA inhibitors (cyclosporin A) |

### Spatiotemporal Regulation

## Nuclear Import Mechanism (2024-2025)

### Capsid as Transport Receptor
| Finding | Study |
|:--------|:------|
| Intact capsids enter FG phase | Nature 2024 |
| Capsid mimics NTRs | Partitions into NPC |
| No trans-acting factors required | Self-transport capability |

### Nuclear Import Selectivity
| Factor | Effect |
|:-------|:-------|
| Capsid size | Smaller cores preferentially imported |
| Capsid elasticity | Required for NPC passage |
| Elasticity mutants | Fail to enter NPC |
| CPSF6-binding mutants | Enter but stall within NPC |

> "HIV-1 nuclear import depends on both capsid elasticity and nuclear pore adaptability. The NPC acts as a selective filter, preferentially importing smaller cores."

## CPSF6 in Nuclear Targeting

### Function
| Role | Details |
|:-----|:--------|
| Post-NPC transport | Releases capsids into nucleoplasm |
| Integration site targeting | Directs to active chromatin |
| Directionality | RanGTP-like function |

### Structural Evidence
| Observation | Significance |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Extra densities on imported cores | Host factor association |
| CPSF6 density at ~63 Å | Mapped on CA hexamer surface |
| A77V mutant phenotype | Accumulates at NPC |

> "CPSF6 releases capsids from NPCs into nuclei, resembling RanGTP in conferring directionality to canonical nuclear import."

## Cryo-ET Methodology

### Integrated Workflow (2025)
| Step | Details |
|:-----|:--------|
| Sample | Permeabilized T cells + isolated cores |
| Imaging | Cryo-correlative workflow |
| Cores analyzed | 1,489 native HIV-1 cores |
| Stages captured | 4 distinct nuclear import stages |

### Structural Resolution

## Capsid Surface Amino Acid Composition

### Nuclear Pore Passage (2025)
> "Nuclear pore passage of the HIV capsid is driven by its unusual surface amino acid composition."

| Feature | Significance |
|:--------|:-------------|
| Surface charge distribution | NPC interaction |
| FG-repeat binding | Phenylalanine-glycine motifs |
| Hydrophobic patches | Transport receptor mimicry |

## Therapeutic Implications

### Drug Targets
| Target | Approach |
|:-------|:---------|
| IP6 binding | Disrupt capsid stability |
| CypA interface | Cyclophilin inhibitors |
| CPSF6 interaction | Block nuclear import |
| Capsid elasticity | Hyperstabilization (lenacapavir) |

## Relevance to Project

HIV capsid structural studies inform the Ternary VAE project:
- **CA sequence constraints**: Residues critical for lattice, IP6, and CypA binding
- **Host factor interfaces**: Conserved surfaces under selection
- **Nuclear import**: Functional constraints on capsid sequence
- **Drug resistance**: Mutations affecting capsid mechanics
