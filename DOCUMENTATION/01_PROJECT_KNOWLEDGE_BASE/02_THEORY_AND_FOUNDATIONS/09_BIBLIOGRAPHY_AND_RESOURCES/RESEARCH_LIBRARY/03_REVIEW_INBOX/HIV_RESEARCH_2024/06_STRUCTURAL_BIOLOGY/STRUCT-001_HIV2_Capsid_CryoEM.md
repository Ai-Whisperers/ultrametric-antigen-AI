# Structural Insights into HIV-2 CA Lattice Formation and FG-Pocket Binding Revealed by Single Particle Cryo-EM

**ID:** STRUCT-001
**Year:** 2024

## Abstract

This study reports the first high-resolution structures of HIV-2 CA (capsid) capsomers in their native mature lattice using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). By templating the assembly of HIV-2 CA on functionalized liposomes, researchers determined high-resolution structures of the HIV-2 CA lattice, including both CA hexamers and pentamers.

## Key Concepts

- **Cryo-EM**: Cryo-electron microscopy for high-resolution structural determination
- **CA Lattice**: Capsid protein arrangement in hexamers and pentamers
- **FG-Pocket**: Phenylalanine-glycine motif binding site for host proteins
- **HIV-2 vs HIV-1**: Comparative structural analysis

## Methodology

| Technique               | Application                             |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Liposome templating     | Scaffold for CA lattice assembly        |
| Single particle cryo-EM | High-resolution structure determination |
| Nup153 peptide binding  | Host factor interaction analysis        |
| CPSF6 peptide binding   | Host factor interaction analysis        |

## Key Findings

### Structures Determined

1. HIV-2 CA hexamers in native lattice
2. HIV-2 CA pentamers in native lattice
3. Complexes with Nup153 FG-peptides
4. Complexes with CPSF6 FG-peptides

### Comparative Insights (HIV-2 vs HIV-1)

| Feature                    | HIV-2                 | HIV-1     |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------- |
| Overall fold               | Conserved             | Reference |
| FG-peptide binding         | Conserved mode        | Reference |
| CypA interactions          | Potentially different | Reference |
| Hexamer/pentamer switching | Different mechanism   | Reference |

## Significance

> "The mechanism of hexamer/pentamer switching appears different between HIV-2 and HIV-1, suggesting divergent evolution of these lentiviral capsid systems."

This reveals:

1. Distinctive structural features defining HIV-2 CA lattice
2. Potential differences in host factor interactions
3. Divergent mechanisms for capsomer assembly

---

## Technical Innovation

- **Lattice Templating Method**: Novel approach enabling direct study of CA lattice under diverse conditions
- Allowed identification of critical role for inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) in pentamer formation
- Structure of CA lattice bound to lenacapavir (GS-6207) determined

---

## Relevance to Project

HIV-2 capsid structures inform:

- Sequence-structure relationships in lentiviruses
- Conserved vs divergent regions between HIV-1/HIV-2
- Druggable sites for capsid inhibitors
- Codon constraints imposed by structural requirements
