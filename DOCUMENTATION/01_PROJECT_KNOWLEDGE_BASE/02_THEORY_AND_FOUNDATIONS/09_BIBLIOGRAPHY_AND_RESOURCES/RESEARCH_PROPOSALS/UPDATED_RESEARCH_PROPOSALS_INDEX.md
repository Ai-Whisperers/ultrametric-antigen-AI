# Updated Research Proposals – Master Index

This document provides a **structured overview** of all research proposals derived from the deep analysis of the `RESEARCH_LIBRARY`. Each proposal is organized by scientific **approach** and lives in its own sub‑folder under `RESEARCH_PROPOSALS/`. The folder hierarchy mirrors the classification, making it easy to locate implementation details and to integrate the work into the repository.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate** to the desired sub‑folder.
2. Open `proposal.md` – it contains a full description, objectives, methodology, required data, and concrete implementation steps (including which files to add/modify in `src/`, `data/`, `scripts/`).
3. Follow the **Implementation Checklist** at the end of each proposal to integrate the work into the main repository.
4. Update the repository’s `README.md` or relevant documentation to link to these proposals as needed.

_All proposals reference the underlying evidence in `RESEARCH_LIBRARY` (e.g., `COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_REPORT.md`, `CARLOS_BRIZUELA_FULL_PROFILE_AND_RESEARCH_REPORT.md`)._
